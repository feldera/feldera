# Connectors: connect to data sources and sinks

A Feldera pipeline can process data from multiple heterogeneous sources and
produce outputs to multiple heterogeneous destinations. To this end it relies
on a growing library of **[input](sources)** and **[output](sinks)** connectors.

## Basics

Users configure connectors using a JSON object, that describes an external source or sink such as a database
table or a Kafka topic. A SQL table can have multiple source connectors attached to it, specified as a
list of JSON connector objects under the `'connectors'` attribute in the `WITH` clause of the table.
Similarly, a views can have multiple sink connectors attached to it.

Here is an example, where the `VENDOR` table has one connector, configured to fetch and insert JSON data
from an HTTP URL, and a `VENDOR_VIEW` which sends the changes of the view
to a Kafka topic in a format that can be consumed by Debezium:

```sql
create table VENDOR (
    id bigint not null primary key,
    name varchar,
    address varchar
) WITH ('connectors' = '[{
    "transport": {
        "name": "url_input", "config": {"path": "https://feldera-basics-tutorial.s3.amazonaws.com/vendor.json"}
    },
    "format": { "name": "json" }
}]');

create view VENDOR_VIEW
WITH (
    'connectors' = '[{
        "max_queued_records": 1000,
        "format": {
            "name": "json",
            "config": {
                "update_format": "debezium"
            }
        },
        "transport": {
            "name": "kafka_output",
            "config": {
                "bootstrap.servers": "redpanda:9092",
                "topic": "test_view"
            }
        }
    }]'
)
as select * from VENDOR;
```

The `WITH` clause for tables needs to be put at the end, after the column definitions, whereas for views it has to
appear before the `AS` clause to resolve any parsing ambiguities.

:::

A connector specification consists of three parts:

* [Generic attributes](#generic-attributes) common to all connectors, such as backpressure thresholds.
* Transport specification (`transport`) for either [input](/connectors/sources/) or [output](/connectors/sinks/)
  defines the data transport to be used by the connector.
  Example transports include [Kafka](/connectors/sources/kafka),
  [URL](/connectors/sources/http-get), [Delta Lake](/connectors/sources/delta), etc.
* [Data format specification](/formats) (`format`), which defines the data format for the connector.
  Example data formats include [CSV](/formats/csv), [JSON](/formats/json), [Parquet](/formats/parquet), or
  Avro).

:::note

Some transports, e.g., [Delta Lake](/connectors/sinks/delta) and
[datagen](/connectors/sources/datagen), use fixed predefined data formats and do not require the
format section in the connector specification.

:::

This architecture allows the user to combine different transports and data formats.

These basics apply to all connectors **except** the HTTP [input](/connectors/sources/http) and
[output](/connectors/sinks/http) connectors which are not managed by the user, as they directly feed/fetch data
into/from a pipeline via dedicated pipeline endpoints and therefore do not need to be configured in the `WITH` clauses
of tables and views.

## Generic attributes

The following attributes are common to all connectors:

* `max_queued_records` - Backpressure threshold. Maximal number of records queued by the endpoint before the endpoint
   is paused by the backpressure mechanism. By default this is set to 1 million.
* `paused` - If set to to true the connector will not fetch or push data to the pipeline when started
   unless [explicitly enabled through the API](/api/change-the-desired-state-of-an-input-endpoint).
   By default this is set to false.

### Configuring the output buffer

By default a Feldera pipeline sends a batch of changes to the output transport
for each batch of input updates it processes.  This can result in a stream of
small updates, which is normal and even preferable for output transports like
[Kafka](/connectors/sinks/kafka); however it can cause performance problems
for other connectors, such as the [Delta Lake connector](/connectors/sinks/delta)
by creating a large number of small files.

The output buffer mechanism is designed to solve this problem by decoupling the
rate at which the pipeline pushes changes to the output transport from the rate
of input changes.  It works by accumulating updates inside the pipeline
for up to a user-defined period of time or until accumulating a user-defined number
of updates and writing them as a single batch to the output transport.

The output buffer can be setup for each individual output connector as part
of connector configuration.  The following parameters are used to configure the
output buffer:

* `enable_output_buffer` - Enable output buffer.

* `max_output_buffer_time_millis` - Maximum time in milliseconds data is kept
   in the output buffer.

   When not specified, data is kept in the buffer indefinitely until one of
   the other trigger conditions is satisfied.  When this option is
   set the buffer will be flushed at most every
   `max_output_buffer_time_millis` milliseconds.

   This configuration option requires the `enable_output_buffer` flag
   to be set.

* `max_output_buffer_size_records` - Maximum number of updates to be kept in
   the output buffer.

   This parameter bounds the maximal size of the buffer.  
   Note that the size of the buffer is not always equal to the
   total number of updates output by the pipeline. Updates to the
   same record can overwrite or cancel previous updates.

   When not specified, the buffer can grow indefinitely until one of
   the other trigger conditions is satisfied.

   This configuration option requires the `enable_output_buffer` flag
   to be set.

:::note

When the `enable_output_buffer` flag is set, at least one of
`max_output_buffer_time_millis` or `max_output_buffer_size_records` must be
specified.

See [Delta Lake output connector documentation](/connectors/sinks/delta)
for an example of configuring the output buffer.
