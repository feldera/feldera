# Get Started

These instructions explain how to run the Feldera Platform on a single machine
in a configuration suitable for demos, development, and testing.  For production
use, or for developing parts of Feldera Platform itself, Feldera Platform
supports other forms of deployment.

## Install prerequisites

To run the demo, you will first need to install Docker and the Docker
Compose plugin.  If you don't already have them, install them one of
these ways:

* On Mac OS, Windows, or Linux, install [Docker Desktop][1], which
  includes the Docker Compose plugin. If you're on Apple Silicon,
  we recommend [enabling Rosetta](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#use-rosetta-for-x86amd64-emulation-on-apple-silicon)
  for x86/amd64 emulation.

* On Linux only, first install [Docker Engine][2] and the [Docker
  Compose plugin][3].

  :::tip

  The plugin implements Docker Compose v2, invoked as `docker
  compose`. Feldera Platform does not support the older Docker Compose v1,
  which was invoked with `docker-compose` (note the `Â ` versus `-`
  distinction).

  :::

  Then, follow the instructions to [manage Docker as a non-root
  user][4].

  :::tip

  If you you only want root to manage Docker, you can prefix
  the `docker compose` command below with `sudo`.

  :::

You also need `curl` and a web browser such as Chrome or Firefox.

## Start the demo

1. Download the `docker-compose.yml` file that tells Docker Compose
   how to set up the demo's containers:

   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feldera/feldera/main/deploy/docker-compose.yml
   ```

   You only need to do the first time.

   :::caution

   This will replace any existing file named `docker-compose.yml` in
   the current directory.

   :::

2. Launch containers for the demo, including the pipeline manager,
   Postgres to support it, and a SecOps demo that uses Redpanda.  From
   the directory where you ran the command above:

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile demo up
   ```

   This command takes over the terminal where you run it as long as
   the demo is active.  It will print a lot of log messages,
   which can be useful for debugging if something goes wrong but which
   otherwise are not important.

   The first time you run this command, it will download container
   images, which can take a while.  Once `docker compose` begins
   bringing up the images, it takes about 10 seconds for the Feldera Platform user
   interface to become available.  On fast systems, this includes a
   pause of a few seconds in which nothing is logged.

3. Visit <http://localhost:8080/> in your web browser to bring up the
   Feldera Platform Console UI.

4. Try out one of the [demos](demo/).

## Stop the demo

To shut down the demo, type <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> in the terminal
where `docker compose` is running.  Docker Compose will show its
progress as it shuts down each of the containers in turn.  It can take
up to about 15 seconds to complete shutdown.

## Restart the demo

If you start and then stop the demo as described above, you can
restart it a few different ways:

* To restart it without changes, run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

* Run this command to reload the demo afresh, while discarding all
  additional programs, connectors and pipelines you've added:

   ```bash
   docker compose --profile demo up
   ```

* Run this command to upgrade to a new version of the demo, while
  discarding all additional programs, connectors and pipelines you've
  added:

  ```bash
  docker compose --profile demo up --pull always --force-recreate -V
  ```

## Troubleshooting

If the demo fails to start after it previously ran successfully, then
it might not have fully shut down from the previous run.  To ensure
that it is fully shut down, run the following command, and then try
starting it again:

```bash
docker compose --profile demo down
```

If starting the demo fails with `bind: address already in use`, then
something on your machine is already listening on one of the ports
required for the demo.  The message should say the particular port.
To correct the problem, find and stop the process listening on the
port, or edit a copy of `docker-compose.yml` to use a different port
number.

## Development
