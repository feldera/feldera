# Feldera Enterprise

Feldera Enterprise is our commercial offering aimed at production use.
It is designed such that you can bring your own cloud, on which you deploy Feldera.
The documentation we provide here is publicly available, both to guide
our existing customers and to provide insight to interested parties.
Feldera Enterprise installation is only possible with a license key.
Please contact us at `learnmore@feldera.com` if you are interested to learn
more or would like to try out Feldera Enterprise. We'd be happy to get you started!

:::tip
Don't forget to first try out the [Docker demo container](/docs/docker), which requires
no license key. The Docker demo already showcases many of Feldera's features.
This documentation is about setting up a distributed cloud deployment.
