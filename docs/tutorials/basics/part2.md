# Part 2: HTTP-based Input and Output

In Part 1 of this tutorial we created a SQL program and ran it as part of a
pipeline.  We manually pushed data to the pipeline using Feldera Web Console.
The next step is to ingest data into SQL tables from external sources and to
send query outputs to external sinks.  Feldera supports two methods to
accomplish this: (1) HTTP-based and (2) connector-based input/output.  We cover
these two methods in this and the next sections of the tutorial respectively.

In Part 2 of the tutorial we will

- Learn to send inputs to and consume outputs from a Feldera pipeline via HTTP.

- Introduce another key concept behind Feldera: *incremental query
  evaluation*.

## Step 1. Restart the pipeline

Start the pipeline you created in Part 1 of the tutorial from a clean state:

- If the pipeline is still running, click <icon icon="bx:stop-circle" /> to shutdown it down.
- Click <icon icon="bx:play-circle" /> to restart the pipeline.

## Step 2. Subscribe to output changes

Subscribe to changes to the `PREFERRED_VENDOR` view:

```bash
curl -s -N -X 'POST' http://localhost:8080/v0/pipelines/supply_chain/egress/PREFERRED_VENDOR?format=json | jq
```

You should see periodic heartbeat messages:

```json
{
  "sequence_number": 0
}
{
  "sequence_number": 1
}
{
  "sequence_number": 2
}
{
  "sequence_number": 3
}
...
```

## Step 3. Populate inputs

In another terminal, use the following command to populate the `PART` table
with the same data we entered manually in part 1 of the tutorial:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' http://localhost:8080/v0/pipelines/supply_chain/ingress/PART?format=json -d '
{"insert": {"id": 1, "name": "Flux Capacitor"}}
{"insert": {"id": 2, "name": "Warp Core"}}
{"insert": {"id": 3, "name": "Kyber Crystal"}}'
```

The request URL includes the table name (`PART`) and the input data format
(`json`).  The request payload consists of newline-delimited JSON objects, where
each object specifies a command (in this case, "insert") and a record to insert.
Records are encoded as JSON objects with one key per table column.

Next, we populate the other two tables:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' http://localhost:8080/v0/pipelines/supply_chain/ingress/VENDOR?format=json -d '
{"insert": {"id": 1, "name": "Gravitech Dynamics", "address": "222 Graviton Lane"}}
{"insert": {"id": 2, "name": "HyperDrive Innovations", "address": "456 Warp Way"}}
{"insert": {"id": 3, "name": "DarkMatter Devices", "address": "333 Singularity Street"}}'

curl -X 'POST' http://localhost:8080/v0/pipelines/supply_chain/ingress/PRICE?format=json -d '
{"insert": {"part": 1, "vendor": 2, "price": 10000}}
{"insert": {"part": 2, "vendor": 1, "price": 15000}}
{"insert": {"part": 3, "vendor": 3, "price": 9000}}'
```

You should now see the following output in the terminal that is listening to changes to the `PREFERRED_VENDOR` view:

```json
{
  "sequence_number": 36,
  "json_data": [
    {
      "insert": {
        "PART_ID": 1,
        "PART_NAME": "Flux Capacitor",
        "VENDOR_ID": 2,
        "VENDOR_NAME": "HyperDrive Innovations",
        "PRICE": "10000"
      }
    },
    {
      "insert": {
        "PART_ID": 2,
        "PART_NAME": "Warp Core",
        "VENDOR_ID": 1,
        "VENDOR_NAME": "Gravitech Dynamics",
        "PRICE": "15000"
      }
    },
    {
      "insert": {
        "PART_ID": 3,
        "PART_NAME": "Kyber Crystal",
        "VENDOR_ID": 3,
        "VENDOR_NAME": "DarkMatter Devices",
        "PRICE": "9000"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

We will learn to decipher this in a moment.  Meanwhile, you can use the Feldera
Web Console to inspect tables and views (click on the <icon icon="bx:show" />
icon next to a table or view to inspect it). For instance, here is the contents
of the `PREFERRED_VENDOR` view:

![PREFERRED_VENDOR](preferred-vendor1.png)

## Step 4. Modify inputs

We already know that Feldera continuously updates output views in response to
input changes.  But what does this mean exactly?  Is it simply a matter of
re-running the queries whenever a change occurs?  Thankfully, Feldera does
something much more efficient.

Let us push some changes to the `PRICE` table, causing query results to change
(make sure that you are still monitoring the `PREFERRED_VENDOR` view in a
separate terminal).  We use `delete` commands to remove existing records.  Note
that there is no `update` command.  Modifying a record amounts to deleting the
old version and inserting the new one.

```bash
curl -X 'POST' http://localhost:8080/v0/pipelines/supply_chain/ingress/PRICE?format=json -d '
{"delete": {"part": 1, "vendor": 2, "price": 10000}}
{"insert": {"part": 1, "vendor": 2, "price": 30000}}
{"delete": {"part": 2, "vendor": 1, "price": 15000}}
{"insert": {"part": 2, "vendor": 1, "price": 50000}}
{"insert": {"part": 1, "vendor": 3, "price": 20000}}
{"insert": {"part": 2, "vendor": 3, "price": 11000}}'
```

Vendors 1 and 2 have increased their prices, while vendor 3 has added more parts
to its price list, becoming the cheapest supplier of parts 1, 2, and 3.  This
yields the following output in the `PREFERRED_VENDOR` view:

```json
{
   "sequence_number" : 84,
   "json_data" : [
      {
         "delete" : {
            "PART_ID" : 1,
            "PART_NAME" : "Flux Capacitor",
            "PRICE" : "10000",
            "VENDOR_ID" : 2,
            "VENDOR_NAME" : "HyperDrive Innovations"
         }
      },
      {
         "insert" : {
            "PART_ID" : 1,
            "PART_NAME" : "Flux Capacitor",
            "PRICE" : "20000",
            "VENDOR_ID" : 3,
            "VENDOR_NAME" : "DarkMatter Devices"
         }
      },
      {
         "delete" : {
            "PART_ID" : 2,
            "PART_NAME" : "Warp Core",
            "PRICE" : "15000",
            "VENDOR_ID" : 1,
            "VENDOR_NAME" : "Gravitech Dynamics"
         }
      },
      {
         "insert" : {
            "PART_ID" : 2,
            "PART_NAME" : "Warp Core",
            "PRICE" : "11000",
            "VENDOR_ID" : 3,
            "VENDOR_NAME" : "DarkMatter Devices"
         }
      },
   ]
}
```

This output contains an array of `insert` and `delete` commands that describe an update
to the view in terms of records that are no longer present and must be deleted
and new records to be added to the view.  The new version of the view can be
constructed by applying these changes to its previous snapshot.

Thus, Feldera does not output the complete view, but only the set of changes to
the previous version of the view.  As more input changes arrive, Feldera
computes additional output updates on top of all previous updates (give it a
try!).

This reflects the internal workings of Feldera: instead of reevaluating the
query from scratch on every new input, it only updates affected outputs by
propagating input changes through the query execution plan.  We refer to this as
**incremental query evaluation**.  See our [paper](/vldb23.pdf) for a rigorous
description of this technique.

## Takeaways

Let us review what we have learned in this part of the tutorial:

- Feldera operates on **changes**: a Feldera pipeline transforms a stream of
  input changes to SQL tables into a stream of output changes to SQL views.

- One way to send input changes to a pipeline and consume output changes from it
  is using HTTP.

- Internally, Feldera also works with changes: the Feldera query engine employs
  incremental algorithms to compute only what has changed in each view without
  requiring a full re-computation.
