# Materialized Tables and Views

By default, Feldera does not maintain the complete contents of tables and views; it only
stores the data necessary to compute future outputs. However, in some cases, users
may need to inspect or query the entire contents of a relation.  This can
be useful in the following scenarios:

* **Debugging**. The user may want to inspect the current contents of tables and views
  to validate their SQL program.
* **Retrieve full state snapshot**.  This is useful, for instance, to sync the output of Feldera with an external
  database on demand.
* [**Ad-hoc queries**](/sql/ad-hoc).  In some applications, users may not want to store a complete copy of the data,
  but instead query it on demand.

Feldera supports such use cases by allowing users to label tables and views as **materialized**.
To declare a materialized table, use the materialized attribute:

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (...) WITH ('materialized' = 'true');
```

To declare a materialized view, use the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` syntax:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_view as SELECT * from my_table;
```

These declarations instruct Feldera to maintain a complete snapshot of the table or view.

## Inspecting materialized tables and views

You can explore the contents of materialized tables and views by issuing `SELECT ...` [ad-hoc SQL queries](/sql/ad-hoc).
Ad-hoc queries are evaluated non-incrementally against the current snapshot of pipeline's tables and views.

You can run ad-hoc queries in [Web Console](/sql/ad-hoc#feldera-web-console), [CLI](/sql/ad-hoc#feldera-cli) or via the [Python SDK](/sql/ad-hoc#feldera-python-sdk).

## Usage considerations

Materialized relations can significantly increase the storage used by the program.
For example, Feldera can evaluate simple programs with no joins or aggregates without keeping
any state.  However, materializing inputs or outputs of such programs will make them
**stateful**, requiring storage proportional to the size of the materialized
relations.

Feldera takes advantage of [`LATENESS` annotations](streaming.md#lateness-expressions)
to garbage collect old records in time series tables and views (i.e., tables and views with
monotonically or near-monotonically growing timestamps).  This allows evaluating complex queries
over unbounded streams using bounded storage.  Materializing these tables forces Feldera to keep
their entire history, resulting in unbounded storage growth.

Finally note that materialized tables and views are **not a performance optimization**.
Feldera automatically maintains all the state needed to incrementally evaluate user queries
efficiently.  Materializing additional relations will not make it faster, but can actually
slow it down, as it needs to write more data to storage.
