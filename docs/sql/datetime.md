## Dates

The date type represents a Gregorian calendar date, independent of
time zone.  This extends to dates before the Gregorian calendar was
introduced, effectively meaning that the dates use a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar">Proleptic
calendar</a>.

### Date literals

`DATE` literals have the form `DATE 'YYYY-MM-DD'`.  Trailing spaces
are not allowed.

Date literals can only represent 4-digit year positive values.
Values BC or values greater than 10,000 years are not supported.

### Date operations

The following operations are available on dates:

<a id="date_trunc"></a>
`DATE_TRUNC(date, <unit>)`, where `<unit>` is a time unit, as
described above, between `MILLENNIUM` and `DAY`.  Result is a `DATE`.
Rounds down the date to the specified time unit.  Example:
`DATE_TRUNC('2020-01-10', MONTH)` produces the result
`2020-01-01`.

<a id="date_extract"></a>
`EXTRACT(<unit> FROM date)` where `<unit>` is a time unit, as
described above.  Result is always a `BIGINT` value.
`DATE_PART` is a synonym for `EXTRACT`.

The following abbreviations can be used as well:

<a id="date_year"></a>
`YEAR(date)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM date)`.

<a id="date_month"></a>
`MONTH(date)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date)`.

<a id="date_dayofmonth"></a>
`DAYOFMONTH(date)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(DAY FROM
date)`.

<a id="date_dayofweek"></a>
`DAYOFWEEK(date)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(DOW FROM
date)`.

<a id="date_hour"></a>
`HOUR(date)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM date)`.
For dates it always returns 0, since dates have no time component.

<a id="date_minute"></a>
`MINUTE(date)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM date)`.
For dates it always returns 0, since dates have no time component.

<a id="date_second"></a>
`SECOND(date)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(SECOND FROM date)`.
For dates it always returns 0, since dates have no time component.

<a id="date_floor"></a>
`FLOOR(date TO <unit>)`, where `<unit>` is a time unit.

<a id="date_ceil"></a>
`CEIL(date TO <unit>)`, where `<unit>` is a time unit.

Values of type `DATE` can be compared using `=`, `<>`, `!=`, `<`, `>`,
`<=`, `>=`, `<=>`, `BETWEEN`; the result is a Boolean.

<a id="date_timestampdiff"></a>
`TIMESTAMPDIFF(<unit>, left, right)` computes the difference between
two dates values and expresses the result in the specified time units.
The result is a 32-bit integer.

## Times

A time represents the time of day, a value between 0 and 24 hours
(excluding the latter).

The `TIME` data type can specify an optional precision, e.g.,
`TIME(2)`.  The precision is the number of sub-second digits
supported.  So `TIME(3)` is a time with a precision of milliseconds.

The default precision is 3.

Currently the maximum supported precision is 3 (milliseconds).  Larger
precisions are accepted, but internally only up to 3 digits of
precision are maintained.

### Time literals

`TIME` literals have the form `TIME 'HH:MM:SS.FFF'`, where the
fractional part is optional, and can have between 0 and 3 digits.  An
example is: '23:59:59.132'.  The hours must be between 0 and 23, the
minutes between 0 and 59, and the seconds between 0 and 59.  Exactly
two digits must be used for hours, minutes, and seconds.  Spaces are
not allowed between quotes.

### Time operations

<a id="time_trunc"></a>
`TIME_TRUNC(time, <unit>)`, where `<unit>` is a time unit,
as described above, between `HOUR` and `SECOND`.  Result is a
`TIME`.  Rounds down the time to the specified time unit.
Example: `TIME_TRUNC('12:34:56.78', MINUTE)` produces the
result `12:34:00`.

<a id="time_extract"></a>
`EXTRACT(<unit> FROM time)` where `<unit>` is a time unit from
`HOUR`, `MINUTE`, `SECOND`, `MILLISECOND`; the semantics is as
described above.  Result is always a `BIGINT` value.

The following abbreviations can be used as well:

<a id="time_hour"></a>
`HOUR(time)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM time)`.

<a id="time_minute"></a>
`MINUTE(time)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM time)`.

<a id="time_second"></a>
`SECOND(time)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(SECOND FROM
time)`.

Values of type `TIME` can be compared using `=`, `<>`, `!=`, `<`, `>`,
`<=`, `>=`, `<=>`, `BETWEEN`; the result is a Boolean.

<a id="timestamp_timestampdiff"></a>
`TIMESTAMPDIFF(<unit>, left, right)` computes the difference between
two time values and expresses the result in the specified time units.
The result is a 32-bit integer.

## Timestamps

The `TIMESTAMP` data type represents values composed of a `DATE` (as
described above) and a `TIME`.  `TIMESTAMP` support an optional
precision specification, e.g.: `TIMESTAMP(3)`.  The precision applies
to the `TIME` component of the `TIMESTAMP`.  The maximum precision
supported for timestamps is 3.  The default precision for timestamps
(used when no precision is specified), is also 3.

### Timestamp literals

`TIMESTAMP` literals have the form `TIMESTAMP 'YYYY-MM-DD
HH:MM:SS.FFF'`, where the fractional part is optional.  Trailing
spaces are not allowed.

Timestamp literals can only represent 4-digit year positive values.
Values BC or values greater than 10,000 years are not supported.

The following operations are available on timestamps:

### Operations on timestamps

A cast from a numeric value to a `TIMESTAMP` interprets the numeric
value as an (big integer) number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.
Conversely, a cast from a `TIMESTAMP` to a numeric value retrieves the
number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch from the timestamp.

<a id="timestamp_trunc"></a>
`TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(timestamp, <unit>)`, where `<unit>` is a time unit,
as described above, between `MILLENNIUM` and `SECOND`.  Result is a
`TIMESTAMP`.  Rounds down the timestamp to the specified time unit.
Example: `TIMESTAMP_TRUNC('2020-01-10 10:00:00', MONTH)` produces the
result `2020-01-01 00:00:00`.

<a id="timestamp_extract"></a>
`EXTRACT(<unit> FROM timestamp)` where `<unit>` is a time unit, as
described above.  Result is always a `BIGINT` value.

The following abbreviations can be used as well:

<a id="timestamp_year"></a>
`YEAR(timestamp)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(YEAR FROM timestamp)`.

<a id="timestamp_month"></a>
`MONTH(timestamp)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(MONTH FROM timestamp)`.

<a id="timestamp_dayofmonth"></a>
`DAYOFMONTH(timestamp)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(DAY FROM
timestamp)`.

<a id="timestamp_dayofweek"></a>
`DAYOFWEEK(timestamp)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(DOW FROM
timestamp)`.

<a id="timestamp_hour"></a>
`HOUR(timestamp)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp)`.

<a id="timestamp_minute"></a>
`MINUTE(timestamp)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM timestamp)`.

<a id="timestamp_second"></a>
`SECOND(timestamp)` is an abbreviation for `EXTRACT(SECOND FROM
timestamp)`.

<a id="timestamp_floor"></a>
`FLOOR(timestamp TO <unit>)`, where `<unit>` is a time unit.

<a id="timestamp_ceil"></a>
`CEIL(timestamp TO <unit>)`, where `<unit>` is a time unit.

Values of type `TIMESTAMP` can be compared using `=`, `<>`, `!=`, `<`,
`>`, `<=`, `>=`, `<=>`, `BETWEEN`; the result is a Boolean.

<a id="timestamp_timestampdiff"></a>
`TIMESTAMPDIFF(<unit>, left, right)` computes the difference between
two timestamps and expresses the result in the specified time units.
The result is a 32-bit integer.  `DATEDIFF` is a synonym for
`TIMESTAMPDIFF`.  One month is considered elapsed when the calendar
month has increased and the calendar day and time is greater than or equal
to the start. Weeks, quarters, and years follow from that.

<a id="timestampadd"></a>
`TIMESTAMPADD(<unit>, integer, timestamp)` adds an interval in the
specified unit to a timestamp.
<a id="dateadd"></a>
`DATEADD` is a synonym for
`TIMESTAMPADD`.  The added value can be negative.  The type of the
result is as follows:

- Adding anything to a `TIMESTAMP` value produces a `TIMESTAMP` result
- Adding a interval of hours, minutes, or seconds to a `DATE` produces a `TIMESTAMP` result
- Adding a an interval of days, months, or longer to a `DATE` produces a `DATE` result

To create a timestamp using the Unix EPOCH in seconds as a base, you
can use the `TIMESTAMPADD` function.  The following code creates a
MAKE_TIMESTAMP function which creates a `TIMESTAMP` given a number of
seconds:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION MAKE_TIMESTAMP(SECONDS BIGINT) RETURNS TIMESTAMP AS
TIMESTAMPADD(SECOND, SECONDS, DATE '1970-01-01');
```

## Time intervals

### The interval types

Note that currently one cannot specify a type of `INTERVAL` for a
table column.  Interval types can be generated by queries though, so
they can appear in the computed views.

### Interval literals

Interval literals (constant values) can be written using the following
verbose syntax:

```
INTERVAL 'string' timeUnit [ TO timeUnit]
```

`tiemUnit` is one of `millisecond`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, `day`,
`week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`, or plurals of these units.  Only
the following combinations are supported:

| Type                        | Example literal                            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `INTERVAL YEAR`             | `INTERVAL '20' YEAR`                       |
| `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH`    | `INTERVAL '20-07' YEAR TO MONTH`           |
| `INTERVAL MONTH`            | `INTERVAL '10' MONTH`                      |
| `INTERVAL DAY`              | `INTERVAL '10' DAY`                        |
| `INTERVAL DAY TO HOUR`      | `INTERVAL '10 10' DAY TO HOUR`             |
| `INTERVAL DAY TO MINUTE`    | `INTERVAL '10 10:30' DAY TO MINUTE`        |
| `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND`    | `INTERVAL '10 10:30:40.999' DAY TO SECOND` |
| `INTERVAL HOUR`             | `INTERVAL '12' HOUR`                       |
| `INTERVAL HOUR TO MINUTE`   | `INTERVAL '12:10' HOUR TO MINUTE`          |
| `INTERVAL HOUR TO SECOND`   | `INTERVAL '12:10:59' HOUR TO SECOND`       |
| `INTERVAL MINUTE`           | `INTERVAL '10' MINUTE`                     |
| `INTERVAL MINUTE TO SECOND` | `INTERVAL '80:01.001' MINUTE TO SECOND`    |
| `INTERVAL SECOND`           | `INTERVAL '80.001' SECOND`                 |

A leading negative sign applies to all fields; for example the
negative sign in the interval literal `INTERVAL '-1 2:03:04' DAYS TO
SECONDS` applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts.

To specify an interval value with more than 2 digits you must specify
an increased precision for the corresponding type, e.g.:
`INTERVAL '100' HOUR(3)`

`EXTRACT(unit FROM interval)` extracts the specified value from an `INTERVAL`.
Short intervals support EXTRACT of values between DAYS and MILLISECONDS.
Long intervals support EXTRACT of values between MILLENIUM and MONTHS.

## Other date/time/timestamp/time interval operations

The following arithmetic operations are supported:

Arithmetic involving a `TIME` value always produces a (positive)
`TIME` value, between `00:00:00` (inclusive) and `24:00:00`
(exclusive).  One can think of the computation as being performed in
nanoseconds, and then performing a modulo operation with the number of
nanoseconds in a day.  For this reason, adding or subtracting a long
interval from a `TIME` value is supported, but always leaves the
`TIME` value unchanged (since long intervals always consist of a whole
number of days).

Arithmetic between a `DATE` and an `INTERVAL` first converts the
interval to a whole number days (rounding down) and then performs the
computation on whole days.

<a id="date_sub"></a> `DATE_SUB` is a synonim for `DATE` - `INTERVAL`.
<a id="date_add"></a> `DATE_ADD` is a synonim for `DATE` + `INTERVAL`.
<a id="abs"></a>`ABS`(interval) computes the absolute value of an
interval.

## Timezones

`DATE`, `TIME` and `TIMESTAMP` have no time zone.

## `NOW`

The `NOW()` function returns the current date and time as a
`TIMESTAMP` value.  More precisely, it returns the date and time
when the current **step** of the pipeline was triggered.  A step
is triggered when the pipeline receives one or more new inputs or after a
user-configurable period of time if no new inputs arrive.
When executing a step, the pipeline incrementally updates all its views.
In particular, views that depend on the value of `NOW()` are updated
using the new current time.  The value of `NOW()` remains constant within a
step.

By default, in the absence of new inputs, a step is triggered every
100 milliseconds.  This behavior is controlled by the
`clock_resolution_usecs` pipeline configuration setting.

| Operation     | Description         | Example                        |
|---------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| `NOW`         | Returns a timestamp | `NOW()` => 2024-07-10 00:00:00 |

:::warning

Programs that use `NOW()` can be very inefficient.  For example, a
program such as `SELECT T.x + NOW() FROM T` has to scan the
entire table T at every step.  Use this function judiciously.

:::

Note however that a specific class of `WHERE` and `HAVING` expressions
that use `NOW()` can be implemented very efficiently.  These are the
so-called "temporal filters".  Here is an example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM T WHERE T.ts >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAYS;
```

In general, a temporal filter will involve inequality or equality
comparisons between an expression and a monotone function of the NOW
result.  A conjunction of such terms is also accepted if all terms
involve the same expression (e.g.: `T.ts >= NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAYS
AND T.ts <= NOW() + INTERVAL 1 DAYS`).

## Date parsing and formatting

We support the following functions for formatting and parsing date-like values:

| Operation          | Arguments             | Result    | Example                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| `FORMAT_DATE`      | string_format, date   | string    | `FORMAT_DATE("%Y-%m", d)` => 2020-10 |
| `PARSE_DATE`       | string_format, string | DATE      | `PARSE_DATE(" %Y-%m-%d", '   2020-10-01')` => `2020-10-01` |
| `PARSE_TIME`       | string_format, string | TIME      | `PARSE_TIME("%H:%m", '10:10')` => `10:10:00` |
| `PARSE_TIMESTAMP`  | string_format, string | TIMESTAMP | `PARSE_TIMESTAMP("%Y-%m", '2020-10')` => `2020-10-01 00:00:00` |

If the string cannot be parsed according to the specified format:

- a runtime error is produced if the format is incorrect for producing
  a value of the required type
- the result is `NULL` if string cannot be parsed according to the format

For the parsing functions the format string must have enough elements
to obtain all elements required for building the result.  For example,
`PARSE_TIME('%I:%M:%S', '10:00:00')` will produce a runtime error,
since the `%I` element does not have enough information to infer
whether the hour is AM or PM (an extra `%p` element is needed).

The format string recognizes the following format specifiers; this
definition follows the Rust `strftime` spec:
https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html
