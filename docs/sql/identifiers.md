# Identifiers

Identifiers are the names of tables, columns and other metadata
elements used in a SQL query.

Unquoted identifiers, such as `emp`, must start with a letter and can
only contain letters, digits, and underscores. They are implicitly
converted to upper case.

Quoted identifiers, such as `"Employee Name"`, start and end with
double quotes. They may contain virtually any character, including
spaces and other punctuation. If you wish to include a double quote in
an identifier, use another double quote to escape it, like this: `"An
employee called ""Fred""."`.

Quoting an identifier also makes it case-sensitive, whereas unquoted
names are always folded to upper case.

A variant of quoted identifiers allows including escaped Unicode
characters identified by their code points. This variant starts with
U& (upper or lower case U followed by ampersand) immediately before
the opening double quote, without any spaces in between, for example
U&"foo".  Inside the quotes, Unicode characters can be specified in
escaped form by writing a backslash followed by the four-digit
hexadecimal code point number. For example, the identifier "data"
could be written as

`U&"d\0061t\0061"`

If a different escape character than backslash is desired, it can be
specified using the UESCAPE clause after the string, for example using
`!` as the escape character:

`U&"d!0061t!0061" UESCAPE '!'`

The escape character can be any single character other than a
hexadecimal digit, the plus sign, a single quote, a double quote, or a
whitespace character. Note that the escape character is written in
single quotes, not double quotes, after UESCAPE.

To include the escape character in the identifier literally, write it
twice.

## Comments

A comment is a sequence of characters beginning with double dashes and
extending to the end of the line, e.g.:

```SQL
-- This is a standard SQL comment
```

Alternatively, C-style block comments can be used:

```
/* multiline comment
 * with nesting: /* nested block comment */
 */
```

where the comment begins with `/*` and extends to the matching
occurrence of `*/`.  Note that block comments cannot be nested unlike
the requirements of the SQL standard.
