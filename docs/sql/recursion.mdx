# Mutually-Recursive Queries

:::warning

Recursive queries are a new feature in Feldera SQL and are still evolving. Syntax and
functionality may change in future versions.

:::

Recursive computations are notoriously limited in standard SQL due to cumbersome syntax and limited expressivity.
Feldera SQL introduces an intuitive and powerful syntax for recursive queries that:

- Removes the need for Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in recursive queries.
- Supports mutually recursive view definitions involving multiple views.
- Allows rich, non-monotonic queries in recursive view definitions, with a goal to support arbitrary queries in the future.

These enhancements make Feldera SQL Turing-complete, meaning recursive queries that never terminate can be written—so
care must be taken when designing queries.

## Key Concepts of Recursive Views

### Defining Recursive Views with Forward Declarations

In Feldera SQL, recursive queries require [forward declarations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_declaration)
when a view references itself or another view before their definition.
A forward declaration specifies the view's name, column names, and column types.

```sql
DECLARE RECURSIVE VIEW CLOSURE(x INT, y INT);
```

This forward declaration states that `CLOSURE` is a recursive view with two columns, `x` and `y`, both of type `INT`.
As we will see next, we can use this view to compute a transitive closure of a graph recursively, where x and y
are nodes in the graph.

### Recursive View Definitions

Once declared, recursive views are defined using standard SQL syntax. Feldera SQL allows these views to
reference each other recursively.

```sql
CREATE TABLE EDGES(x INT, y INT);

-- Define a local view STEP depending on CLOSURE and EDGES
CREATE LOCAL VIEW STEP AS
SELECT E.x, CLOSURE.y
FROM EDGES E
JOIN CLOSURE ON E.y = CLOSURE.x;

-- Define the recursive view CLOSURE
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW CLOSURE AS
(SELECT * FROM EDGES)
UNION
(SELECT * FROM STEP);
```

In this example we compute a transitive closure:

- `EDGES` represents the edges of a graph.
- The `CLOSURE` view represents the edges of a graph over the same nodes, such that CLOSURE is the transitive
  closure of the EDGES graph.

Forward declarations are needed only when:

- A view is referenced before its definition.
- The view participates in mutual recursion.

For example, if `STEP` were not a local view, it would also require a forward declaration.

The type inferred by the compiler for the view based on the query must
match the type of the declared view, including the column names.

## Semantics

- Mutually recursive views start out empty and are computed iteratively until they reach a stable state
  (i.e., no further changes occur). This is the least fixed point semantics, which is common in programming
  languages but differs from recursion in standard SQL.

- All mutually recursive views are automatically treated as `DISTINCT` (e.g., as if they have a `SELECT DISTINCT` in their
  definition) to avoid infinite growth due to duplicate rows. Without these restrictions, (and if we replace `UNION`
  with `UNION ALL` in the view definition), the program that computes `CLOSURE` above would never terminate and the
  `CLOSURE` table would keep growing, accumulating duplicate edges.

We can verify this using our previous program and using the [Feldera Shell](/reference/cli)

```sql
INSERT INTO EDGES VALUES(0, 1);
SELECT * FROM CLOSURE;
 x | y
-------
 0 | 1
(1 row)
INSERT INTO EDGES VALUES(1, 2);
SELECT * FROM CLOSURE;
 x | y
-------
 0 | 1
 1 | 2
 0 | 2
(3 rows)
DELETE * FROM EDGES WHERE x = 0;
SELECT * FROM CLOSURE;
 x | y
-------
 1 | 2
(1 row)
```

## Debugging Recursive SQL

SQL with non-terminating or long-running recursion should be avoided. e.g., the following SQL will attempt to
create a view that computes all Fibonacci numbers. However, this program will fail (due to overflow) once
it reaches values that do not fit into a 32-bit integer:

```sql
declare recursive view fibonacci(n int, value int);

create view fibonacci as
(
    -- Base case: first two Fibonacci numbers
    select 0 as n, 0 as value
    union all
    select 1 as n, 1 as value
)
union all
(
    -- Compute F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)
    select
        curr.n + 1 as n,
        (prev.value + curr.value) as value
    from fibonacci as curr
    join fibonacci as prev
    on prev.n = curr.n - 1
);

create view fib_outputs as select * from fibonacci;
```

Recursive computations are evaluated in a single [circuit step](https://www.feldera.com/blog/synchronous-streaming),
so there’s no intermediate output in the change stream. This can make debugging recursive queries challenging.

To debug, you can use a [a UDF](/sql/udf). For example, modify the previous example to use a Rust function that
prints each invocation of the fibonacci view during recursion:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="program.sql" label="program.sql" default>
    ```sql
    create function logger(n int not null, value int not null) returns int not null;
    declare recursive view fibonacci(n int not null, value int not null);

    create view fibonacci as
    (
        -- Base case: first two Fibonacci numbers
        select 0 as n, 0 as value
        union all
        select 1 as n, 1 as value
    )
    union all
    (
        -- Compute F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)
        select
            logger(curr.n + 1, prev.value + curr.value) as n,
            (prev.value + curr.value) as value
        from fibonacci as curr
        join fibonacci as prev
        on prev.n = curr.n - 1
    );

    create view fib_outputs as select * from fibonacci;
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="udf.toml" label="udf.toml">
    ```toml
    log = "0.4"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="udf.rs" label="udf.rs">
    ```rust
    pub fn logger(n: i32, v: i32) -> Result<i32, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        log::info!("n={n} v={v}");
        Ok(n)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If we run the pipeline and inspect the log we now can see the following output before the pipeline crashes:

```text
...
2024-11-21 00:36:16 INFO [pipeline-01934bea-8b46-71c2-9809-7eacf89f926d] n=44 v=701408733
2024-11-21 00:36:16 INFO [pipeline-01934bea-8b46-71c2-9809-7eacf89f926d] n=45 v=1134903170
2024-11-21 00:36:16 INFO [pipeline-01934bea-8b46-71c2-9809-7eacf89f926d] n=46 v=1836311903
```

The 46-th fibonacci value is the last one that fits in a 32-bit integer.

### Bounding Recursion Depth

The fix is to bound the recursion depth, e.g., by adding a `WHERE` clause to the `fibonacci` view:

```sql
declare recursive view fibonacci(n int not null, value int not null);

create view fibonacci as
(
    -- Base case: first two Fibonacci numbers
    select 0 as n, 0 as value
    union all
    select 1 as n, 1 as value
)
union all
(
    -- Compute F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2)
    select
        curr.n + 1 as n,
        (prev.value + curr.value) as value
    from fibonacci as curr
    join fibonacci as prev
    on prev.n = curr.n - 1
    where curr.n <= 45
);

create view fib_outputs as select * from fibonacci;
```

## Supported and Unsupported Features

### Supported Constructs

Feldera supports a wide range of operators in recursive queries, including:

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- All types of `JOINs`
- Aggregations, `DISTINCT`, `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`
- `UNNEST`, `VALUES`, `PIVOT`
- Table functions like `HOP` and `TUMBLE`

It is also possible to create a recursive [*materialized* view](/sql/materialized), which stores the result of
the recursive computation for [ad-hoc queries](/sql/ad-hoc).

### Unsupported Constructs

The following are currently not supported in recursive queries:

- Window functions (e.g., `OVER` clauses)

### Known Limitations

- Recursive queries mixed with [streaming annotations](streaming) currently can not leverage garbage collection.
