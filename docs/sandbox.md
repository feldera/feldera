# Feldera Cloud Sandbox

Feldera maintains an online sandbox where you can try tutorials and
demos to help you learn about Feldera's product and features, without
having to install anything yourself.

Inside the sandbox, you can pick any demo that suits your situation.
Each demo is a pre-built configuration consisting of a SQL program
that runs in a pipeline.  Each pipeline receives input rows into
tables and automatically generates results from the views.

The sandbox automatically shuts down a pipeline after 24 hours of
runtime.  We will occasionally refresh the deployment, which may
entirely delete pipelines.  Please talk to a Feldera employee in one
of our [community channels](https://www.feldera.com/community) if
you'd like to keep an experiment going for longer than that.

Usage of the cloud sandbox is governed by Feldera [Terms of
Service](https://www.feldera.com/terms).
