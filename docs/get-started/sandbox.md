# Feldera Sandbox

Feldera maintains a free [online sandbox](https://try.feldera.com) where you can try tutorials and
demos to learn about Feldera's features, without
having to install anything yourself.

The sandbox automatically shuts down a pipeline after 24 hours of
runtime.  We will occasionally refresh the deployment, which may
entirely delete pipelines.  Please talk to a Feldera employee in one
of our [community channels](https://www.feldera.com/community) if
you'd like to keep an experiment going for longer than that.

Usage of the cloud sandbox is governed by Feldera [Terms of
Service](https://www.feldera.com/terms).
