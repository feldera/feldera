# Step 1: Assets

In its installation, Feldera Cloud requires several assets, most notably
Helm packages and container images. These assets are made available to you
along with your Feldera license key. They are not publicly available.
Please contact us at `learnmore@feldera.com` if you would like to try
out Feldera Cloud.

:::tip
Reach out to us at `support@feldera.com` if you have not yet received
the assets along with your Feldera license key.

The typical workflow for customers would be to host the Feldera-supplied
artifacts in their own container registry (like ECR). Customers will
also have direct access to the Feldera registry using IAM credentials.
