# Supported Data Types

The compiler supports the following SQL data types:

- `BOOLEAN`, or `BOOL`, represented as a Boolean value
- `TINYINT`, represented as an 8-bit signed integer using two's
  complement.
- `SMALLINT`, or `INT2`, represented as a 16-bit signed integer using two's
  complement.
- `INTEGER`, or `INT`, or `SIGNED`, or `INT4`, represented as a 32-bit signed integer,
  using two's complement
- `BIGINT`, or `INT64`, represented as a 64-bit signed integer, using two's
  complement
- `DECIMAL(precision, scale)`, or `NUMERIC(precision, scale)`,
  a high precision fixed-point type,
  with a precision (number of decimal digits after decimal point) and
  a scale (total number of decimall digits)
- `FLOAT`, or `FLOAT4`, or `FLOAT32`, an IEEE 32-bit floating point number
- `DOUBLE`, or `FLOAT8`, or `FLOAT32`, an IEEE 64-bit floating point number
- `VARCHAR(n)`, or `CHAR(n)`, or `CHARACTER(n)`, or `CHARACTER
  VARYING(n)`, a string value with maximum fixed width
- `VARCHAR`, or `STRING`, or `TEXT`: a string of unlimited length
- `NULL`, a type comprising only the `NULL` value
- `INTERVAL`, a SQL interval.  Two types of intervals are supported:
  long intervals (comprising years and months), and short intervals,
  comprising days, hours, minutes, seconds.
- `TIME`, the time of the day, with a precision of nanoseconds.
- `TIMESTAMP`, a SQL timestamp without a timezone.  A timestamp
  represents a value containing a date and a time, with a precision up
  to a millisecond.
- `DATE`, a SQL date without a timezone.  A date represents a value
  containing a date (year, month, day).
- `GEOMETRY`: geographic data type (only rudimentary support at this point)
- `ARRAY`: used as a suffix for another type, as in `INT ARRAY`.
  An array with element of the specified type.


A suffix of `NULL` or `NOT NULL` can be appended to a type name to
indicate the nullability.  A type with no suffix is not nullable by
default.

## Computations on nullable types

A type is nullable if it can represent the `NULL` value.  For input
tables the nullability of a column is declared explicitly.  For
intermediate results and output views the compiler infers the
nullability of each column using type inference rules.

Most SQL operations are defined for nullable types.  Our compiler
follows the SQL standard in this respect.  Most operations (e.g.,
`+`), when applied a `NULL` operand will produce a `NULL`
value.

## Grammar for specifying types

```
type:
      typeName
      [ collectionsTypeName ]*

typeName:
      sqlTypeName
  |   compoundIdentifier

sqlTypeName:
      char [ precision ] [ charSet ]
  |   varchar [ precision ] [ charSet ]
  |   DATE
  |   time
  |   timestamp
  |   GEOMETRY
  |   decimal [ precision [, scale] ]
  |   BOOLEAN
  |   integer
  |   TINYINT
  |   SMALLINT
  |   BIGINT
  |   REAL
  |   double
  |   FLOAT
  |   ANY [ precision [, scale] ]

collectionsTypeName:
      ARRAY

char:
      CHARACTER | CHAR

varchar:
      char VARYING | VARCHAR

decimal:
      DECIMAL | DEC | NUMERIC

integer:
      INTEGER | INT

varbinary:
      BINARY VARYING | VARBINARY

double:
      DOUBLE [ PRECISION ]

time:
      TIME [ precision ] [ timeZone ]

timestamp:
      TIMESTAMP [ precision ] [ timeZone ]

charSet:
      CHARACTER SET charSetName

timeZone:
      WITHOUT TIME ZONE
