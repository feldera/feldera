# What is Feldera?

Feldera **Continuous Analytics Platform**, also known as
**Feldera Platform**, is a set of containerized services packaging a fast
data computational engine for **continuous analytics**. Feldera Platform allows
users to run continuous queries directly on data in motion, without storing
the data in databases or storage systems, before querying.

With Feldera Platform, DML and DDL SQL written for popular databases can operate
continuously, with few changes, on data as it continuously arrives. This
site explains the concepts behind Feldera Platform and how to use it
through its user interface and API.

Feldera Platform's implementation is based on a streaming algebra called "DataBase
Stream Processor", [DBSP](https://www.feldera.com/vldb23.pdf).
