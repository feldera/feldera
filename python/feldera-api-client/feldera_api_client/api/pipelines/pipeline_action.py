     Change the desired state of the pipeline.

    This endpoint allows the user to control the execution of the pipeline,
    by changing its desired state attribute (see the discussion of the desired
    state model in the [`PipelineStatus`] documentation).

    The endpoint returns immediately after validating the request and forwarding
    it to the pipeline. The requested status change completes asynchronously.
    On success, the pipeline enters the requested desired state.  On error, the
    pipeline transitions to the `Failed` state. The user
    can monitor the current status of the pipeline by polling the `GET
    /pipeline` endpoint.

    The following values of the `action` argument are accepted by this endpoint:

    - 'start': Start processing data.
    - 'pause': Pause the pipeline.
    - 'shutdown': Terminate the execution of the pipeline.

    Args:
