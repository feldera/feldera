    Attributes:
        created (datetime.datetime): Time when the pipeline started executing.
        current_status (PipelineStatus): Pipeline status.

            This type represents the state of the pipeline tracked by the pipeline
            runner and observed by the API client via the `GET /pipeline` endpoint.

            ### The lifecycle of a pipeline

            The following automaton captures the lifecycle of the pipeline.  Individual
            states and transitions of the automaton are described below.

            * In addition to the transitions shown in the diagram, all states have an
            implicit "forced shutdown" transition to the `Shutdown` state.  This
            transition is triggered when the pipeline runner is unable to communicate
            with the pipeline and thereby forces a shutdown.

            * States labeled with the hourglass symbol (⌛) are **timed** states.  The
            automaton stays in timed state until the corresponding operation completes
            or until the runner performs a forced shutdown of the pipeline after a
            pre-defined timeout perioud.

            * State transitions labeled with API endpoint names (`/deploy`, `/start`,
            `/pause`, `/shutdown`) are triggered by invoking corresponding endpoint,
            e.g., `POST /v0/pipelines/{pipeline_id}/start`.

            ### Desired and actual status

            We use the desired state model to manage the lifecycle of a pipeline.
            In this model, the pipeline has two status attributes associated with
            it at runtime: the **desired** status, which represents what the user
            would like the pipeline to do, and the **current** status, which
            represents the actual state of the pipeline.  The pipeline runner
            service continuously monitors both fields and steers the pipeline
            towards the desired state specified by the user.
            Only three of the states in the pipeline automaton above can be
            used as desired statuses: `Paused`, `Running`, and `Shutdown`.
            These statuses are selected by invoking REST endpoints shown
            in the diagram.

            The user can monitor the current state of the pipeline via the
            `/status` endpoint, which returns an object of type `Pipeline`.
            In a typical scenario, the user first sets
            the desired state, e.g., by invoking the `/deploy` endpoint, and
            then polls the `GET /pipeline` endpoint to monitor the actual status
            of the pipeline until its `state.current_status` attribute changes
            to "paused" indicating that the pipeline has been successfully
            initialized, or "failed", indicating an error.
        desired_status (PipelineStatus): Pipeline status.

            This type represents the state of the pipeline tracked by the pipeline
            runner and observed by the API client via the `GET /pipeline` endpoint.
