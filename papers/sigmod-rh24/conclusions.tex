\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}%\label{sec:ddlog}

We have introduced \dbsp, a model of computation based on infinite
streams over commutative groups.  In this model streams are used for 3
purposes: (1) to model consecutive snapshots of a database, (2) to
model consecutive changes (deltas, or transactions) applied to a
database and changes of a maintained view, (3) to model consecutive
values of loop-carried variables in recursive computations.

We have defined an abstract notion of incremental computation over
streams, and defined the incrementalization operator $\inc{\cdot}$,
which transforms an \emph{arbitrary} stream computation $Q$ into its
incremental version $\inc{Q}$.  The incrementalization operator has
some very nice algebraic properties, which gave us a general algorithm
for incrementalizing many classes of complex queries, including
arbitrary recursive queries.

We believe that \dbsp can form a solid foundation for a theory and practice of
streaming incremental computation.
