    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to an ML model. While raw data represents individual events, features summarize many raw events, e.g., average readings collected over a period of time. When raw input data arrives continuously in real-time, feature computation must also be performed in real-time in order to supply the ML model with up-to-date inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Building real-time feature pipelines using existing tools like Flink and Spark Structured Streaming is notoriously hard. **Feldera simplifies this task dramatically**. As a user, you simply express your features as SQL queries. Feldera runs these queries over historical data in order to compute feature vectors for model training and testing. Then, during inference, Feldera evaluates **the same queries** over streaming inputs in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use Feldera to build a real-time credit card fraud detector. In particular, we: \n",
    "* Write SQL queries that define several interesting features, based on data enrichment and rolling aggregates.\n",
    "* Compute feature vectors and train an ML model on a historical data set stored in a Delta Lake.\n",
    "* Use the same queries to compute feature vectors over a real-time stream of credit card transactions."

    "## USE CASE: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION\n",
    "Credit card fraud detection is a classic application of real-time feature engineering. Here, data comes in a stream of **transactions**, each with attributes like card number, purchase time, vendor, and amount. Additionally, the fraud detector has access to a slowly changing table with **demographics** information about cardholders, such as age and address.\n",

    "## MODEL TRAINING AND TESTING\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding an optimal set of features to train a good ML model is an iterative process. At every step, the data scientist trains and tests a model using currently selected feature queries on labeled historical data. The results of each experiment drive the next refinement of feature queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Feature queries\n",
    "\n",
    "We define several features over our input tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data enrichment:\n",
    "  * We add demographic attributes, such as zip code, to each transaction\n",
    "* Rolling aggregates:\n",
    "  * average spending per transaction in the past day, week, and month\n",
    "  * average spending per transaction over a 3-month timeframe on the same day of the week\n",
    "  * number of transactions made with this credit card in the last 24 hours\n",
    "* Other:\n",
    "  * `is_weekend` - transaction took place on a weekend\n",
    "  * `is_night` - transaction took place before 6am\n",
    "  * `d` - day of week\n",

    "The following Python function uses the Feldera Python SDK to creates an SQL program, consisting of two tables with raw input data (`TRANSACTION` and `DEMOGRAPHICS`) and the `FEATURE` view, which computes the above features over these tables."

    "In this example we used Feldera to evaluate *the same feature queries* first over historical (batch) data and then over a combination of historical and streaming inputs.  Feldera's ability to operate on any combination of batch and streaming sources eliminates the need to develop multiple implementations of the same queries for development and production environments.  **In fact, Feldera does not distinguish between the two**.  It processes inputs in the same way and produces the same outputs, whether they arrive frequently in small groups (aka streaming) or occasionally in bigger groups (aka batch).\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon receiving new inputs, Feldera updates its output views without full re-computation, by doing work proportional to the size of the new data rather than the size of the entire database.  This **incremental evaluation** makes Feldera efficient for both streaming and batch inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we would like to emphaize that **Feldera is strongly consistent**. If\n",
    "we pause our inference pipeline and inspect the contents of the output view\n",
    "produced by Feldera so far, it will be **precisely the same as if we ran the\n",
    "query on all the inputs received so far as one large batch**.  Unpause the\n",
    "pipeline and run it a little longer.  The pipeline will receive some additional\n",
    "inputs and produce additional outputs, but it still preserves the same\n",
    "input/output guarantee.  This property, known as **strong consistency**, ensures\n",
