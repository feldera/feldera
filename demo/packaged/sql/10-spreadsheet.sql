-- Tutorial: Building a spreadsheet using Feldera (spreadsheet)
--
-- A copy of the billion-cell spreadsheet demo from https://github.com/feldera/techdemo-spreadsheet.
--

-- Given a cell value as a formula (e.g., =A0+B0), and a context with cell values
-- referenced in the formula, returns the computed value of the cell
create function cell_value(cell varchar(64), mentions_ids bigint array, mentions_values varchar(64) array) returns varchar(64);

-- Given a cell value e.g., =A0+B0, returns an array of cell ids that were mentioned in the formula
create function mentions(cell varchar(64)) returns bigint array;

-- Forward declaration of spreadsheet view
declare recursive view spreadsheet_view (
     id bigint not null,
     background integer not null,
     raw_value varchar(64) not null,
     computed_value varchar(64)
);

-- Raw spreadsheet cell data coming from backend/user, updates
-- are inserted as new entries with newer timestamps
create table spreadsheet_data (
     id bigint not null,
     ip varchar(45) not null,
     ts timestamp not null,
     raw_value varchar(64) not null,
     background integer not null
