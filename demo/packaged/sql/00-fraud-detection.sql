-- Use Case: Feature Engineering for Real-Time Fraud Detection (fraud-detection)
--
-- Build real-time feature pipelines in SQL.
--
-- ## How to run
--
-- * Paste this SQL code in the Feldera WebConsole and hit Play ▶️.
-- * In the Change Stream tab, select the `transaction_with_aggregates` view.
-- * You should see feature vectors being produced in real-time as the
--   data generator pushes input changes to the pipeline.
--
-- ## Detailed description
--
-- When it comes to fraud detection, training an accurate ML model is only the
-- beginning. To ensure its effectiveness, you must supply the model with
-- up-to-date features computed from the latest data.
--
-- Feldera's unique incremental query engine makes it an ideal compute platform for
-- fraud detection teams:
--
-- * Expressive: Write complex feature pipelines in SQL
-- * Unified online/offline processing: run the same SQL queries during model
--   training and real-time inference.
-- * Throughput: process millions of records per second on a single host.
-- * Feature freshness: Upon ingesting new events, Feldera outputs new and
--   updated feature vectors within milliseconds.
-- * No online/offline skew: Feldera guarantees identical outputs on batch and
--   streaming inputs.
--
-- In this example we show how to implement two important types of feature
-- queries in Feldera:
--
-- * Data enrichment queries, which combine (or enrich) raw transaction data
--   with data from other sources.
-- * Rolling aggregate queries: foe each event in a time series, compute an
--   aggregate (e.g., count, sum, average, etc.) over a fixed time frame
--  preceding this event.
