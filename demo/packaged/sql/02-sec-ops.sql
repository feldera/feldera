-- Use Case: Incremental Analytics for Security Operations (sec-ops)
--
-- Detect security vulnerabilities in Kubernetes deployments in real-time.
--
-- This example illustrates the use of incremental analytics to detect security
-- vulnerabilities affecting production Kubernetes deployments in real-time.
-- It tracks security vulnerabilities as they propagate through the software supply
-- chain, instantly updating the list of affected Kubernetes objects in response
-- to input changes.
--
-- ## How to run
--
-- * Paste this SQL code in the Feldera WebConsole and hit Play ▶️.
-- * In the Change Stream tab, select the `k8scluster_vulnerability_stats` view.
-- * You should see vulnerability counts change in real-time as the
--   data generator pushes input changes to the pipeline.
--
-- ## Detailed Description
--
-- We analyze how security vulnerabilities propagate through the software supply
-- chain starting from source code into production Kubernetes cluster:
--
-- 1. A vulnerability is introduced into source code in a particular Git commit.
--    We assume that this vulnerability is detected and reported by a security scanner.
-- 2. The affected commit is picked up by a CI/CD pipeline, which uses it to
--    generate one or more binary artifacts.
-- 3. These binary artifacts are deployed in a Kubernetes cluster.
--
-- Traditional batch analytics tools implement this analysis by periodically
-- re-running all queries from scratch, which can take hours, ultimately
-- delaying the discovery of vulnerabilities.
--
-- In contrast, Feldera evaluates the queries incrementally, instantly updating
-- SQL views whenever new or modified data is added to the input tables.
--
-- We configure Feldera's builtin data generator to produce a continuous stream
-- of updates to input tables, which model Kubernetes clusters, CI/CD pipelines, Git
-- commits, etc.
--
-- ## Takeaways
--
-- This example illustrates how Feldera can run complex analytical workloads in real-time:
--
-- * It enables users to convert slow batch jobs into real-time pipelines,
--   reducing time to results from hours to seconds.
--
-- * Feldera allows constructing complex analytical pipelines in a modular way
--   by breaking them up into multiple views, with more complex views being
--   defined on top of simpler views.
