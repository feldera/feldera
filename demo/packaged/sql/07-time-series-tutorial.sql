-- Tutorial: Time Series Analysis with Feldera (time-series-tutorial)
--
-- Learn to effectively work with time series data in Feldera.
--
-- This program accompanies the guide to Time Series Analysis with Feldera: https://docs.feldera.com/tutorials/time-series
--
-- Each view definition demonstrates one concept from the guide.
--
-- Example inputs:
-- Insert the following records in the `purchase` table and observe how
-- the views change in response:
--
--    INSERT INTO purchase VALUES(1, '2020-01-01 01:00:00', 10);
--    INSERT INTO purchase VALUES(1, '2020-01-01 02:00:00', 10);
--    INSERT INTO purchase VALUES(1, '2020-01-02 00:00:00', 10);
--    INSERT INTO purchase VALUES(1, '2020-01-02 01:00:00', 10);


-- This table uses two time-series-related annotations:
-- `LATENESS` - updates to this table can arrive no more than 1 hour out of order.
-- `append_only` - records are only inserted to this table, but never deleted.
