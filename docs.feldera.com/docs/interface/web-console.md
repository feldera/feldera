# Web Console

The Web Console is the most convenient starting point to using Feldera. Simply
aim your web browser at a running Feldera instance (and authenticate if
required). This is typically `127.0.0.1:8080` if you are using our Docker
instance or [try.feldera.com](https://try.feldera.com) if you are using our public cloud sandbox.
