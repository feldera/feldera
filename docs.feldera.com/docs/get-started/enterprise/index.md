# Feldera Enterprise

Feldera Enterprise is our commercial offering aimed at production use.
It let's you bring your own cloud or Kubernetes Cluster,
on which you deploy Feldera. Your data never leaves your premises.

Feldera Enterprise adds
[features](/architecture/enterprise) that are not available in the
Docker offering. This includes multi-node clusters, pipeline and control plane
fault-tolerance, pipeline resource isolation, pipeline scale-out (coming soon),
and dedicated support.

The documentation we provide here is publicly available, both to guide
our existing customers and to provide insight to interested parties.

:::info
Using Feldera Enterprise requires a license key. Please [contact
