# Connectors: connect to data sources and sinks

A Feldera pipeline can process data from multiple heterogeneous sources and
produce outputs to multiple heterogeneous destinations. To this end it relies
on a growing library of **[input](sources)** and **[output](sinks)** connectors.

## Basics

Users configure connectors using a JSON object, that describes an external source or sink such as a database
table or a Kafka topic. A SQL table can have multiple source connectors attached to it, specified as a
list of JSON connector objects under the `'connectors'` attribute in the `WITH` clause of the table.
Similarly, a views can have multiple sink connectors attached to it.

Here is an example, where the `VENDOR` table has one connector, configured to fetch and insert JSON data
from an HTTP URL, and a `VENDOR_VIEW` which sends the changes of the view
to a Kafka topic in a format that can be consumed by Debezium:

```sql
create table VENDOR (
    id bigint not null primary key,
    name varchar,
    address varchar
) WITH ('connectors' = '[{
    "transport": {
        "name": "url_input", "config": {"path": "https://feldera-basics-tutorial.s3.amazonaws.com/vendor.json"}
    },
    "format": { "name": "json" }
}]');

create view VENDOR_VIEW
WITH (
    'connectors' = '[{
        "max_queued_records": 1000,
        "format": {
            "name": "json",
            "config": {
                "update_format": "debezium"
            }
        },
        "transport": {
            "name": "kafka_output",
            "config": {
                "bootstrap.servers": "redpanda:9092",
                "topic": "test_view"
            }
        }
    }]'
)
as select * from VENDOR;
```

:::info

The `WITH` clause for tables needs to be put at the end, after the column definitions, whereas for views it has to
appear before the `AS` clause to resolve any parsing ambiguities.

:::

A connector specification consists of three parts:

* [Generic attributes](#generic-attributes) common to all connectors, such as backpressure thresholds.
* Transport specification (`transport`) for either [input](/connectors/sources/) or [output](/connectors/sinks/)
  defines the data transport to be used by the connector.
  Example transports include [Kafka](/connectors/sources/kafka),
  [URL](/connectors/sources/http-get), [Delta Lake](/connectors/sources/delta), etc.
* [Data format specification](/formats) (`format`), which defines the data format for the connector.
  Example data formats include [CSV](/formats/csv), [JSON](/formats/json), [Parquet](/formats/parquet), or
  Avro.

:::note

Some transports, e.g., [Delta Lake](/connectors/sinks/delta) and
[datagen](/connectors/sources/datagen), use fixed predefined data formats and do not require the
format section in the connector specification.

:::

This architecture allows the user to combine different transports and data formats.

These basics apply to all connectors **except** the HTTP [input](/connectors/sources/http) and
[output](/connectors/sinks/http) connectors which are not managed by the user, as they directly feed/fetch data
into/from a pipeline via dedicated pipeline endpoints and therefore do not need to be configured in the `WITH` clauses
of tables and views.

## Generic attributes

The following attributes are common to all connectors:

* `name` - The name that is given to the connector, which must be
  unique among the connectors of the table or view. This is particularly
  useful to define when wanting to refer to it, for example to
  [start or pause it at runtime](/connectors/orchestration).
  By default, this is randomly generated.

* `paused` - If set to to true the connector will not fetch or push data to the pipeline when started
   unless [explicitly enabled through the API](/api/start-resume-or-pause-the-input-connector).
   By default this is set to false.

* `labels` - An optional list of text labels associated with the connector.
  This property is used in conjunction with the `start_after` property
  to implement [automatic connector orchestration](/connectors/orchestration#automatic-connector-orchestration).

* `start_after` - Specifies one or more labels. When this property is set, the connector is created
  in the Paused state and is automatically activated once all connectors tagged with at least one
  of the specified labels have finished ingesting data.  This property is used in conjunction with the `labels` property
  to implement [automatic connector orchestration](/connectors/orchestration#automatic-connector-orchestration).

* `max_queued_records` - The approximate maximum number of records to
  keep in memory.  For an input connector, this is the maximum number
  that the endpoint will read into memory, before the endpoint pauses
  further reading until the pipeline has consumed some of the backlog.
  For an output connector, this is the maximum number that the
  endpoint will hold in memory waiting for the output endpoint to send
  them, before the circuit pauses execution until the backlog
  subsides.  By default, this is 1,000,000.

* `max_batch_size` - For an input connector, the approximate maximum
  number of records that the pipeline will process in a single
  pipeline step.  By default, this is 10,000.

* `index` â€“ *(Output connectors only)* The name of an index created by a SQL
  CREATE INDEX statement that defines
  the unique key for the view. This allows the connector to combine related
  insert and delete events into a single atomic update.
  See [Uniqueness Constraints](/connectors/unique_keys).

### Configuring the output buffer

By default a Feldera pipeline sends a batch of changes to the output transport
for each batch of input updates it processes.  This can result in a stream of
small updates, which is normal and even preferable for output transports like
[Kafka](/connectors/sinks/kafka); however it can cause performance problems
for other connectors, such as the [Delta Lake connector](/connectors/sinks/delta)
by creating a large number of small files.

The output buffer mechanism is designed to solve this problem by decoupling the
rate at which the pipeline pushes changes to the output transport from the rate
of input changes.  It works by accumulating updates inside the pipeline
for up to a user-defined period of time or until accumulating a user-defined number
of updates and writing them as a single batch to the output transport.

The output buffer can be setup for each individual output connector as part
of connector configuration.  The following parameters are used to configure the
output buffer:

* `enable_output_buffer` - Enable output buffer.

* `max_output_buffer_time_millis` - Maximum time in milliseconds data is kept
   in the output buffer.

   When not specified, data is kept in the buffer indefinitely until one of
   the other trigger conditions is satisfied.  When this option is
   set the buffer will be flushed at most every
   `max_output_buffer_time_millis` milliseconds.

   This configuration option requires the `enable_output_buffer` flag
   to be set.

* `max_output_buffer_size_records` - Maximum number of updates to be kept in
   the output buffer.

   This parameter bounds the maximal size of the buffer.
   Note that the size of the buffer is not always equal to the
   total number of updates output by the pipeline. Updates to the
   same record can overwrite or cancel previous updates.

   When not specified, the buffer can grow indefinitely until one of
   the other trigger conditions is satisfied.

   This configuration option requires the `enable_output_buffer` flag
   to be set.

:::note

When the `enable_output_buffer` flag is set, at least one of
`max_output_buffer_time_millis` or `max_output_buffer_size_records` must be
specified.

See [Delta Lake output connector documentation](/connectors/sinks/delta)
for an example of configuring the output buffer.
