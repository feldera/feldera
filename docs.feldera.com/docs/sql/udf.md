# User-Defined Functions

The SQL statement `CREATE FUNCTION` can be used to declare new
functions.  Functions can be implemented either in SQL or in Rust.

## User-defined functions written in SQL

The following example shows a user-defined function:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION contains_number(str VARCHAR NOT NULL, value INTEGER)
RETURNS BOOLEAN NOT NULL
AS (str LIKE ('%' || CAST(value AS VARCHAR) || '%'));

CREATE VIEW V0 AS SELECT contains_number(CAST('YES: 10 NO:5' AS VARCHAR), 5)
```

## User-defined functions written in Rust

:::warning Experimental feature

Rust UDF support is currently experimental and may undergo significant changes, including
non-backward-compatible modifications, in future releases of Feldera.

:::

:::danger

* Feldera's incremental query engine assumes that all computations are deterministic. Using
  a non-deterministic UDF is likely to result in incorrect outputs. The SQL compiler cannot verify
  that Rust functions meet this requirement. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the UDF
  developer to ensure that their UDFs are deterministic, i.e., the function's return value
  must depend solely on its arguments and not on clocks, random number generators, external
  data sources, or other sources of non-determinism.

  We are considering adding support for non-deterministic UDFs in the future. If your use case
  requires a non-deterministic UDF, please share your feedback by commenting on the associated
  [GitHub issue](https://github.com/feldera/feldera/issues/2619)

* UDFs are compiled into native binary code and executed directly within the address space of
  the pipeline. Therefore, only trusted code should be included in UDFs.  UDFs should not contain
  panics or invoke undefined behaviors. These can lead to crashes, memory corruption, or
  unpredictable behavior within the pipeline.  UDFs should handle all runtime errors gracefully,
  by returning a `Result::Err()` ([see below](#return-types)). This ensures that errors are
  propagated in a controlled manner and can be handled by the calling code.
:::

Feldera supports UDFs implemented in Rust. To define a UDF, users declare the function
in SQL without providing a body. The corresponding Rust implementation is supplied in a separate
Rust file, which contains the logic for all UDFs declared within the SQL program. A complete
set of files that defines the pipeline in this case is:

| File          | Description                                                                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `program.sql` | The SQL code, including table, view, and user-defined function declarations.                        |
| `stubs.rs`    | Auto-generated by the SQL compiler; contains Rust stubs for UDFs ([see below](#step-2-locate-the-auto-generated-rust-prototype)).|
| `udf.rs`      | User-provided implementation of UDFs in Rust.                                                       |
| `udf.toml`    | User-provided list of external crates required by the code in `udf.rs`. This list is appended to the `[dependencies]` section of the `Cargo.toml` file. |


We recommend using the Web Console to develop and debug Rust UDFs, as described
below.  The Web Console code editor has a separate tab for each of these files,
and supports an interactive development workflow.  Once ready, the creation and
deployment of the pipeline can be automated with scripts that make use of the
[Feldera CLI](#using-feldera-cli), the [Python API](#using-feldera-python-sdk),
or the [REST API](#using-the-rest-api).  These scripts and the SQL/Rust code can
then be maintained with the usual practices such as version control.


### Step 1: Declare a function in the SQL program using `CREATE FUNCTION`

Declare a SQL function without a body:

```sql
-- UDF which encodes text in base64.
CREATE FUNCTION base64(s VARBINARY) RETURNS VARCHAR;
```

### Step 2: Locate the auto-generated Rust prototype

When the SQL compiler encounters such a function, it generates a Rust stub for it in the `stubs.rs`
file.  The stub is an implementation of the UDF in Rust that simply invokes another function with the
same name and signature exported from the `udf.rs` module:

```rust
/* stubs.rs */
...

pub fn base64(s: Option<ByteArray>) -> Result<Option<String>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    udf::base64(
        s)
}
```

The `udf::base64` function does not exist yet, so you will see a Rust compiler error similar to this:

```
 error[E0425]: cannot find function `base64` in module `udf`
  --> project01926e00-f404-7813-b65c-d66ac9959998/src/stubs.rs:11:10
   |
11 |     udf::base64(
   |          ^^^^^^ not found in `udf`
```

### Step 3: Implement the UDF in Rust

Copy the declaration from `stubs.rs` to `udf.rs` and replace its body with the actual implementation:

```rust
/* udf.rs */
use feldera_sqllib::*;
use base64::prelude::*;

pub fn base64(s: Option<ByteArray>) -> Result<Option<SqlString>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    Ok(s.map(|v| SqlString::from_ref(BASE64_STANDARD.encode(v.as_slice()))))
}
```

The `use feldera_sqllib::*` directive imports the definitions of the
Rust types that the compiler uses to implement some of the SQL
datatypes.  The next section explains what these types are.

If your UDF uses external crates, list these external dependencies in `udf.toml`.
The contents of this file is appended to the `[dependencies]` section in the generated
`Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
base64 = "0.22.1"
```

### Step 4: Deploy the UDF

#### Using [Feldera CLI](/interface/cli):

```bash
fda create udf_fda_test --udf-rs udf.rs --udf-toml udf.toml program.sql
```

### SQL type representation in Rust

:::caution Experimental feature

:::

The following table shows the Rust representation of standard SQL data
types.  A nullable SQL type is represented by the corresponding rust
`Option<>` type.  Notice that some of these types are not standard
Rust types, but are defined in the
[feldera-sqllib](https://docs.rs/feldera-sqllib/0.27.0/feldera_sqllib/)
crate, which is part of the Feldera SQL runtime.

| SQL                      | Rust                                    |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `BOOLEAN`                | `bool`                                  |
| `TINYINT`                | `i8`                                    |
| `SMALLINT`               | `i16`                                   |
| `INT`                    | `i32`                                   |
| `BIGINT`                 | `i64`                                   |
| `DECIMAL(p, s)`          | `feldera_sqllib::SqlDecimal`            |
| `REAL`                   | `feldera_sqllib::F32`                   |
| `DOUBLE`                 | `feldera_sqllib::F64`                   |
| `CHAR`, `CHAR(n)`        | `feldera_sqllib::SqlString`             |
| `VARCHAR`, `VARCHAR(n)`  | `feldera_sqllib::SqlString`             |
| `BINARY`, `BINARY(n)`, `VARBINARY`, `VARBINARY(n)` | `feldera_sqllib::ByteArray`           |
| `NULL`                   | `()`                                    |
| `INTERVAL`               | `feldera_sqllib::ShortInterval`, `feldera_sqllib::LongInterval` |
| `TIME`                   | `feldera_sqllib::Time`                  |
| `TIMESTAMP`              | `feldera_sqllib::Timestamp`             |
| `DATE`                   | `feldera_sqllib::Date`                  |
| `T ARRAY`                | `feldera_sqllib::Array<T>`              |
| `MAP<K, V>`              | `feldera_sqllib::Map<K, V>`             |
| `UUID`                   | `feldera_sqllib::Uuid`                  |
| `VARIANT`                | `feldera_sqllib::Variant`               |
| `ROW`                    | `Tup`N                                  |
| User-defined struct type | `Tup`N                                  |

Multiple SQL types may be represented by the same Rust type.  For
example, `CHAR`, `CHAR(n)`, `VARCHAR(n)`, and `VARCHAR` are all
represented by the `SqlString` type.

The SQL family of `INTERVAL` types translates to one of two Rust
types: `ShortInterval` (representing intervals from days to seconds),
and `LongInterval` (representing intervals from years to months).
(Our dialect of SQL does not allow mixing the two kinds of intervals
in a single expression.)

Currently `feldera_sqlllib::Map` is defined as `type Map =
Arc<BTreeMap>`, and `feldera_sqlllib::Array` is defined as `type Array
= Arc<Vec>`.  Currently `feldera_sqlllib::SqlString` is a thin wrapper
type around the `ArcStr` type from the `arcstr` crate.

A `ROW` type with N fields represented by a Rust `Tup`N datatype.  A
user-defined structure type is also represented by a tuple `Tup`N
type.  These tuple types can be imported from the current crate.

Here are some examples using `ROW` and user-defined types:

```sql
CREATE TYPE X AS (x int);
CREATE FUNCTION f(arg X) RETURNS X;
CREATE FUNCTION g(x int NOT NULL) RETURNS ROW(a INT, b INT) NOT NULL;
CREATE VIEW V AS SELECT f(X(1)), g(2).a;
```

And here is a possible implementation of the used-defined functions
`f` and `g` in Rust:

```rust
use crate::{Tup1, Tup2};
use feldera_sqllib::*;
pub fn f(x: Option<Tup1<Option<i32>>>) ->
   Result<Option<Tup1<Option<i32>>>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
   match x {
      None => Ok(None),
      Some(x) => match x.0 {
         None => Ok(Some(Tup1::new(None))),
         Some(x) => Ok(Some(Tup1::new(Some(x + 1)))),
      }
   }
}

pub fn g(x: i32) -> Result<Tup2<i32, i32>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
   Ok(Tup2::new(x-1, x+1))
}
```

### Return types

In the Rust implementation the function always has to return the type
`Result<T, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>`, where `T` is the Rust
equivalent of the expected return type of the SQL function.  The Rust
function should return an `Err` only when the function fails at
runtime with a fatal condition, e.g., array index out of
bounds, arithmetic overflows, etc.

### Developing complex UDFs

While many useful UDFs can be implemented with just a few lines of Rust,
some may require more complex code that is easier to develop
using a full-featured Rust IDE.  To support the development of such
UDFs, we made the `feldera-sqllib` crate available on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/feldera-sqllib).
In order to implement a complex Rust UDF (or a library of UDFs) using
a Rust IDE:

* Create a new Rust crate to serve as the container for your UDFs.
* Add `feldera-sqllib` as a dependency to `Cargo.toml` (use the crate
  version that matches the version of Feldera you are working with).
* Implement and test your UDFs within this crate.
* Copy the final Rust code and dependencies to the Feldera Web Console.

If your UDFs require a larger Rust project with multiple modules, we
recommend encapsulating the majority of the UDF logic in a crate.
This crate can be hosted on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or GitHub.
Import this crate to your Feldera pipeline via the `udf.toml` file,
including only wrapper functions that call the API of this crate in
`udf.rs`.

## Limitations

* Currently only limited implicit casts are inserted by the compiler for the
  function arguments and function result in the SQL program.  For
  example, a call such as `CONTAINS_NUMBER('2010-10-20', '5')` will
  fail at SQL compilation time because the first argument has type
  `CHAR(8)` instead of `VARCHAR`, and the second argument has type
  `CHAR(1)` instead of `INTEGER`.  This can be avoided by calling the
  function using an explicit cast: `CONTAINS_NUMBER(CAST('2010-10-20'
  AS VARCHAR), CAST('5' AS INTEGER))`.

* User-defined functions cannot have names identical to standard SQL
  library function names.

* Polymorphic functions are not supported.  For example, in SQL the
  addition operation operates on any numeric types; such an operation
  cannot be implemented as a single user-defined function.
