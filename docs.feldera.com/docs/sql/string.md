# String Operations

SQL defines two primary character types: `character varying(n)` and
`character(n)`, where n is a positive integer.  Both of these types
can store strings up to n characters (not bytes) in length. An attempt
to store a longer string into a column of these types will result in
an error, unless the excess characters are all spaces, in which case
the string will be truncated to the maximum length. (This somewhat
bizarre exception is required by the SQL standard.)  If the string to
be stored is shorter than the declared length, values of type
character will be space-padded; values of type character varying will
simply store the shorter string.

In addition, we provide the `text`, or `varchar` type, which stores
strings of any length.

Trailing spaces are removed when converting a character value to one
of the other string types.  Note that trailing spaces are semantically
significant in character varying and text values, and when using
pattern matching (e.g., LIKE  and regular expressions).

## String constants (literals)

A string constant in SQL is an arbitrary sequence of characters
bounded by single quotes (`'`), for example `'This is a string'`. To
include a single-quote character within a string constant, write two
adjacent single quotes, e.g., `'Dianne''s horse'`. Note that this is
not the same as a double-quote character (`"`).

Two string constants that are only separated by whitespace with at
least one newline are concatenated and effectively treated as if the
string had been written as one constant. For example:

```sql
SELECT 'foo'
'bar'
```

is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT 'foobar'
```

but:

```sql
SELECT 'foo'      'bar'
```

is not valid syntax.

## Escaped characters

We also accepts escaped characters withing string constants, which are
an extension to the SQL standard.  Within an escape string, a
backslash character (`\`) begins a C-like backslash escape sequence, in
which the combination of backslash and following character(s)
represent a special byte value:

|Backslash Escape Sequence|Interpretation|
|-------------------------|--------------|
|<code>\b</code>          | backspace    |
|<code>\f</code>          | form feed    |
|<code>\n</code>          | newline      |
|<code>\r</code>          | carriage return |
|<code>\t</code>          | tab          |
|<code>\o, \oo, \ooo</code> | (o = 0–7) octal byte value |
|<code>\xh, \xhh (h = 0–9, A–F)</code> | hexadecimal byte value |
|<code>\uxxxx, \Uxxxxxxxx (x = 0–9, A–F)</code> | 16 or 32-bit hexadecimal Unicode character value |

Any other character following a backslash is taken literally. Thus, to
include a backslash character, write two backslashes `\\`. Also, a
single quote can be included in an escape string by writing `\'`, in
addition to the normal way of `''`.

## `LIKE`

string `LIKE` pattern [`ESCAPE` escape-character]

string `NOT LIKE` pattern [`ESCAPE` escape-character]

If pattern does not contain percent signs or underscores, then the
pattern only represents the string itself; in that case `LIKE` acts
like the equals operator. An underscore (`_`) in pattern stands for
(matches) any single character; a percent sign (`%`) matches any
sequence of zero or more characters.

Some examples:

```sql
'abc' LIKE 'abc'    true
'abc' LIKE 'a%'     true
'abc' LIKE '_b_'    true
'abc' LIKE 'c'      false
```

`LIKE` pattern matching always covers the entire string. Therefore, if
it's desired to match a sequence anywhere within a string, the pattern
must start and end with a percent sign.

To match a literal underscore or percent sign without matching other
characters, the respective character in pattern must be preceded by
the escape character. The default escape character is the backslash
but a different one can be selected by using the ESCAPE clause. To
match the escape character itself, write two escape characters.  The
escape character cannot be one of the special pattern characters `_`
or `%`.

Some examples where the escape character is changed to `#`:

```sql
SELECT 'hawkeye' LIKE 'h%' ESCAPE '#'          true
SELECT 'hawkeye' NOT LIKE 'h%' ESCAPE '#'      false
SELECT 'h%' LIKE 'h#%' ESCAPE '#'              true
SELECT 'h%' NOT LIKE 'h#%' ESCAPE '#'          false
SELECT 'h%wkeye' LIKE 'h#%' ESCAPE '#'         false
SELECT 'h%wkeye' NOT LIKE 'h#%' ESCAPE '#'     true
SELECT 'h%wkeye' LIKE 'h#%%' ESCAPE '#'        true
SELECT 'h%wkeye' NOT LIKE 'h#%%' ESCAPE '#'    false
SELECT 'h%awkeye' LIKE 'h#%a%k%e' ESCAPE '#'   true
```

When either argument or `LIKE`, `NOT LIKE` is `NULL`, the result is `NULL`.

## `ILIKE`

string `ILIKE` pattern

string `NOT ILIKE` pattern

The `ILIKE` expression performs a case-insensitive pattern match. If the pattern does not contain percent signs or underscores, then the pattern represents the string itself, and `ILIKE` acts like the equals operator, ignoring character case. An underscore (`_`) in the pattern matches any single character, while a percent sign (`%`) matches any sequence of zero or more characters.

Some examples:

```sql
SELECT 'hawkeye' ILIKE 'h%'        true
SELECT 'hawkeye' NOT ILIKE 'h%'    false
SELECT 'hawkeye' ILIKE 'H%'        true
SELECT 'hawkeye' NOT ILIKE 'H%'    false
SELECT 'hawkeye' ILIKE 'H%Eye'     true
SELECT 'hawkeye' NOT ILIKE 'H%Eye' false
SELECT 'Hawkeye' ILIKE 'h%'        true
SELECT 'Hawkeye' NOT ILIKE 'h%'    false
SELECT 'ABC'     ILIKE '_b_'       true
SELECT 'ABC'     NOT ILIKE '_b_'   false
```
When either argument or `ILIKE`, `NOT ILIKE` is `NULL`, the result is `NULL`.

## POSIX regular expressions

Regular expressions are matched using the `RLIKE` function.  If either
argument of `RLIKE` is `NULL`, the result is also `NULL`.

The description below is from the [Postgres
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/functions-matching.html#FUNCTIONS-POSIX-REGEXP),
where credit is given to Henry Spencer.

POSIX regular expressions provide a more powerful means for pattern
matching than the `LIKE` and `SIMILAR TO` operators.  Many Unix tools
such as `egrep`, `sed`, or `awk` use a pattern matching language that
is similar to the one described here.

Currently our compiler does *not* support `SIMILAR TO` regular
expressions.

A regular expression is a character sequence that is an abbreviated
definition of a set of strings (a regular set). A string is said to
match a regular expression if it is a member of the regular set
described by the regular expression. As with `LIKE`, pattern
characters match string characters exactly unless they are special
characters in the regular expression language — but regular
expressions use different special characters than `LIKE` does. Unlike
`LIKE` patterns, a regular expression is allowed to match anywhere
within a string, unless the regular expression is explicitly anchored
to the beginning or end of the string.

A *regular expression* is defined as one or more *branches*, separated
by `|`. It matches anything that matches one of the branches.

A *branch* is zero or more *quantified atoms* or *constraints*,
concatenated. It matches a match for the first, followed by a match
for the second, etc.; an empty branch matches the empty string.

A *quantified atom* is an *atom* possibly followed by a single
*quantifier*. Without a quantifier, it matches a match for the
atom. With a quantifier, it can match some number of matches of the
atom. An atom can be any of the possibilities shown in the Table
below.

<table>
   <tr>
      <th>Atom</th>
      <th>Description</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>(re)</code></td>
      <td>where <code>re</code> is any regular expression: matches a match for <code>re</code>, with the match noted for possible reporting</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>(?:re)</code></td>
      <td>as above, but the match is not noted for reporting (a “non-capturing” set of parentheses)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>.</code></td>
      <td>matches any single character</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>[chars]</code></td>
      <td>a bracket expression, matching any one of the chars (see below for more details)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>\k</code></td>
      <td>where <code>k</code> is a non-alphanumeric character): matches that character taken as an ordinary character, e.g.,
          <code>\\</code> matches a backslash character</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>\c</code></td>
      <td>where <code>c</code> is alphanumeric (possibly followed by other characters): is an escape, see below</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td><code>&#123;</code></td>
      <td>when followed by a character other than a digit, matches the left-brace character <code>&#123;</code>;
          when followed by a digit, it is the beginning of a bound (see below)</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>x</td>
      <td>where <code>x</code> is a single character with no other significance, matches that character</td>
   </tr>
</table>

The possible quantifiers and their meanings are shown the Table below.

|Quantifier|Matches|
|----------|-------|
|`*`  | a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom|
|`+`    | a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom|
|`?`    | a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom|
|`{`m`}`  | a sequence of exactly m matches of the atom|
|`{`m`,}` | a sequence of m or more matches of the atom|
|`{`m`,`n`}`| a sequence of m through n (inclusive) matches of the atom; m cannot exceed n|

<!--
|`*?`   | non-greedy version of *|
|`+?`   | non-greedy version of +|
|`??`   | non-greedy version of ?|
|`{`m`}?` | non-greedy version of {m}|
|`{`m`,}?`| non-greedy version of {m,}|
|`{`m`,`n`}?` | non-greedy version of {m,n}|
-->

A constraint matches an empty string, but matches only when specific
conditions are met. A constraint can be used where an atom could be
used, except it cannot be followed by a quantifier. The simple
constraints are shown in the Table below; some more constraints are
described later.

|Constraint|    Description|
|----------|---------------|
|`^`       |    matches at the beginning of the string |
|`$`       |    matches at the end of the string       |

<!--
|(?=re)    |    positive lookahead matches at any point where a substring matching re begins (AREs only)
|(?!re)    |    negative lookahead matches at any point where no substring matching re begins (AREs only)
|(?<=re)   |    positive lookbehind matches at any point where a substring matching re ends (AREs only)
|(?<!re)   |    negative lookbehind matches at any point where no substring matching re ends (AREs only)
-->


### Bracket Expressions

A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed in `[]`. It
normally matches any single character from the list (but see
below). If the list begins with `^`, it matches any single character
not from the rest of the list. If two characters in the list are
separated by `-`, this is shorthand for the full range of characters
between those two (inclusive) in the collating sequence, e.g., `[0-9]`
in ASCII matches any decimal digit. It is illegal for two ranges to
share an endpoint, e.g., `a-c-e`.  Ranges are very
collating-sequence-dependent, so portable programs should avoid
relying on them.

To include a literal `]` in the list, make it the first character
(after `^`, if that is used). To include a literal `-`, make it the
first or last character, or the second endpoint of a range. To use a
literal `-` as the first endpoint of a range, enclose it in `[.` and
`.]`.  With the exception of these characters, some combinations using
`[`, all other special characters lose their special significance
within a bracket expression. In particular, `\` is not special.

Within a bracket expression, the name of a character class enclosed in
`[:` and `:]` stands for the list of all characters belonging to that
class. A character class cannot be used as an endpoint of a range. The
POSIX standard defines these character class names:

|Class| Description                          |
|-----|--------------------------------------|
|`alnum`| letters and numeric digits           |
|`alpha`| letters                              |
|`blank`| space and tab                        |
|`cntrl`| control characters                   |
|`digit`| numeric digits                       |
|`graph`| printable characters except space    |
|`lower`| lower-case letters                   |
|`print`| printable characters including space |
|`punct`| punctuation                          |
|`space`| any white space                      |
|`upper`| upper-case letters                   |
|`xdigit`| hexadecimal digits                   |

Class-shorthand escapes provide shorthands for certain commonly-used
character classes. They are shown in the table below.

|Escape|        Description|
|------|-------------------|
|`\d`    |matches any digit, like [[:digit:]] |
|`\s`    |matches any whitespace character, like [[:space:]] |
|`\w`    |matches any word character, like [[:word:]] |
|`\D`    |matches any non-digit, like [^[:digit:]] |
|`\S`    |matches any non-whitespace character, like [^[:space:]] |
|`\W`    |matches any non-word character, like [^[:word:]] |

The behavior of these standard character classes is generally
consistent across platforms for characters in the 7-bit ASCII set.
Whether a given non-ASCII character is considered to belong to one of
these classes depends on the collation that is used for the
regular-expression function or operator.

### Regular Expression Escapes

Escapes are special sequences beginning with `\` followed by an
alphanumeric character.  Escapes come in several varieties: character
entry, class shorthands, constraint escapes, and back references. A
`\` followed by an alphanumeric character but not constituting a valid
escape is illegal.

Character-entry escapes exist to make it easier to specify
non-printing and other inconvenient characters in REs. They are shown
in the Table below.

|Escape|        Description|
|------|-------------------|
|`\a`     |alert (bell) character, as in C|
|`\b`     |backspace, as in C |
|`\B`     |synonym for backslash (\) to help reduce the need for backslash doubling|
|`\c`X    |(where X is any character) the character whose low-order 5 bits are the same as those of X, and whose other bits are all zero|
|`\e`     |the character whose collating-sequence name is ESC, or failing that, the character with octal value 033 |
|`\f`     |form feed, as in C |
|`\n`     |newline, as in C |
|`\r`     |carriage return, as in C |
|`\t`     |horizontal tab, as in C |
|`\u`wxyz |(where wxyz is exactly four hexadecimal digits) the character whose hexadecimal value is 0xwxyz |
|`\v`     |vertical tab, as in C|
|`\x`hhh  |(where hhh is any sequence of hexadecimal digits) the character whose hexadecimal value is 0xhhh (a single character no matter how many hexadecimal digits are used)|
|`\0`     |the character whose value is 0 (the null byte)|
|`\`xy    |(where xy is exactly two octal digits, and is not a back reference) the character whose octal value is 0xy|
|`\`xyz   |(where xyz is exactly three octal digits, and is not a back reference) the character whose octal value is 0xyz|

Hexadecimal digits are 0-9, a-f, and A-F. Octal digits are 0-7.

A constraint escape is a constraint, matching the empty string if
specific conditions are met, written as an escape. They are shown in
the Table below.

|Escape|Description|
|------|-----------|
|`\A`     |matches only at the beginning of the string (see Section 9.7.3.5 for how this differs from ^)|
|`\m`     |matches only at the beginning of a word|
|`\M`     |matches only at the end of a word|
|`\y`     |matches only at the beginning or end of a word|
|`\Y`     |matches only at a point that is not the beginning or end of a word|
|`\Z`     |matches only at the end of the string|

A back reference `(\`n`)` matches the same string matched by the
previous parenthesized subexpression specified by the number n (see
the Table below). For example, `([bc])\1` matches `bb` or `cc` but not
`bc` or `cb`. The subexpression must entirely precede the back
reference in the RE. Subexpressions are numbered in the order of their
leading parentheses. Non-capturing parentheses do not define
subexpressions. The back reference considers only the string
characters matched by the referenced subexpression, not any
constraints contained in it. For example, `(^\d)\1` will match `22`.

|Escape|        Description|
|------|-------------------|
|`\`m     |(where m is a nonzero digit) a back reference to the m'th subexpression|
|`\`mnn   |(where m is a nonzero digit, and nn is some more digits, and the decimal value mnn is not greater than the number of closing capturing parentheses seen so far) a back reference to the mnn'th subexpression|

### Capture groups

A common way to use regexes is with _capture groups_. That is, instead
of just looking for matches of an entire regex, parentheses are used
to create groups that represent part of the match.

For example, consider a string with multiple lines, and each line has
three whitespace delimited fields where the second field is expected
to be a number and the third field a boolean.  This can be expressed
with the following regular expression, where the capture groups have
been labeled `$0` to `$4`.

```
(?m)^\s*(\S+)\s+([0-9]+)\s+(true|false)\s*$
^^^^    ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^
 $1      $2       $3           $4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
               $0
```

Capture group 0 always corresponds to an implicit unnamed group that
includes the entire match.  If a match is found, this group is always
present.

Subsequent groups may be named and are numbered, starting at 1, by the
order in which the opening parenthesis appears in the pattern.  For
example, in the pattern `(?<a>.(?<b>.))(?<c>.)`, `a`, `b` and `c`
correspond to capture groups `$1`, `$2` and `$3`, respectively.

### Regular expression functions

```sql
REGEXP_REPLACE(expr, pat[, repl])
```

If `repl` is missing, it is assumed to be the empty string.

Replaces occurrences in the string `expr` that match the regular
expression specified by the pattern `pat` with the replacement string
`repl`, and returns the resulting string.  If any of `expr`, `pat`, or
`repl` is `NULL`, the return value is `NULL`.

#### Replacement string syntax

All instances of `$N` in the replacement string are replaced with the
substring corresponding to the capture group identified by `N`.

`N` may be an integer corresponding to the index of the capture group
(counted by order of opening parenthesis where 0 is the entire match)
or it can be a name (consisting of letters, digits or underscores)
corresponding to a named capture group.

If `N` isn’t a valid capture group (whether the name doesn’t exist or
isn’t a valid index), then it is replaced with the empty string.

The longest possible name is used. For example, `$1a` looks up the
capture group named `1a` and not the capture group at index `1`. To
exert more precise control over the name, use braces, e.g., `${1}a`.

To write a literal `$` use `$$`.

Examples:

```
select regexp_replace('1078910', '[^01]');
1010

select regexp_replace('deep fried', '(?<first>\w+)\s+(?<second>\w+)', '${first}_$second');
deep_fried

select regexp_replace('Springsteen, Bruce', '([^,\s]+),\s+(\S+)', '$2 $1');
Bruce Springsteen

select regexp_replace('Springsteen, Bruce', '(?<last>[^,\s]+),\s+(?<first>\S+)', '$first $last');
Bruce Springsteen
```

Note that using `$2` instead of `$first` or `$1` instead of `$last`
would produce the same result.
