# Pipeline Metrics

<!-- This file is automatically generated.  Do not edit!

To update the documentation, please edit metrics.md.in instead and

This reference lists all of the metrics that Feldera exports through
its `/metrics` endpoint in [Prometheus exposition format].  It is
automatically generated using the documentation embedded in Prometheus
output.

All of the metrics exported by a particular Feldera pipeline are
labeled with the pipeline's UUID as `pipeline`.  Some metrics have
additional labels, as documented below.

See [Monitoring and Profiling] for a guide to setting up Prometheus
and Grafana with Feldera.  The [Feldera template dashboard] is a
sample Grafana dashboard for Feldera.

# Process Metrics

These metrics report statistics for a running Feldera pipeline
process.  When a pipeline process is killed and restarts from a
checkpoint, the new process's metrics are for it alone, not cumulative
with any previous instantiations.

These metrics are intended to match the standard [Prometheus
definitions].

[Prometheus definitions]: https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_clientlibs/#process-metrics

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `process_cpu_seconds_total` |counter | Total user and system CPU time spent in seconds. |
| `process_max_fds` |gauge | Maximum number of open file descriptors. |
| `process_open_fds` |gauge | Number of open file descriptors. |
| `process_resident_memory_bytes` |gauge | Resident set size in bytes. |
| `process_start_time_seconds` |counter | Start time of the process in seconds since the Unix epoch. |
| `process_threads` |gauge | Number of OS threads in the process. |
| `process_virtual_memory_bytes` |gauge | Virtual memory size in bytes. |
| `process_virtual_memory_max_bytes` |gauge | Maximum amount of virtual memory available in bytes. |

## Feldera metrics

These metrics report statistics for Feldera operations.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `feldera_checkpoint_latency_seconds` |histogram | Latency of overall checkpoint operations in seconds |
| `feldera_checkpoint_records_processed_total` |counter | Total number of records that had processed when the most recent checkpoint successfully committed. |
| `feldera_checkpoint_written_bytes` |histogram | Amount of data written to storage during checkpoints, in bytes. |

## DBSP metrics

These metrics report statistics for [DBSP], the low-level mechanism on
which Feldera is built.

[DBSP]: https://docs.rs/dbsp/latest/dbsp/

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `compaction_stall_duration_seconds` |counter | Time in seconds a worker was stalled waiting for more merges to complete. |
| `dbsp_operator_checkpoint_latency_seconds` |histogram | Latency of individual operator checkpoint operations in seconds. (Because checkpoints run in parallel across workers, these will not add to `feldera_checkpoint_latency_seconds`.) |
| `dbsp_step_latency_seconds` |histogram | Latency of DBSP steps over the last 60 seconds or 1000 steps, whichever is less, in seconds |
| `dbsp_steps_total` |counter | Total number of DBSP steps executed. |

## Record Processing

These metrics report overall counts of records as they pass through
the pipeline.  They accumulate across checkpoint and resume.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `output_buffered_batches` |gauge | Number of batches of records currently buffered by the output connector. |
| `records_input_buffered` |gauge | Total amount of data currently buffered by all endpoints, in records. |
| `records_input_buffered_bytes` |gauge | Total amount of data currently buffered by all endpoints, in bytes. |
| `records_input_bytes_total` |counter | Total amount of data received from all connectors, in bytes. |
| `records_input_total` |counter | Total amount of data received from all connectors, in records. |
| `records_late_total` |counter | Number of records dropped due to LATENESS annotations. |
| `records_processed_bytes_total` |counter | Total amount of input processed by the pipeline, in bytes. |
| `records_processed_total` |counter | Total amount of input processed by the pipeline, in records. |

## Storage Performance

These metrics report the performance of storage, which allows Feldera
to work with data larger than memory.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `files_created_total` |counter | Total number of files created. |
| `files_deleted_total` |counter | Total number of files deleted. |
| `storage_read_block_bytes` |histogram | Sizes in bytes of blocks read from storage. |
| `storage_read_latency_seconds` |histogram | Read latency for storage blocks in seconds |
| `storage_sync_latency_seconds` |histogram | Sync latency in seconds |
| `storage_write_block_bytes` |histogram | Sizes in bytes of blocks written to storage. |
| `storage_write_latency_seconds` |histogram | Write latency for storage blocks in seconds |

## Pipeline Status

These metrics report the status of the pipeline.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `pipeline_complete` |counter | Transitions from 0 to 1 when pipeline completes. |
| `pipeline_start_time_seconds` |counter | Start time of the pipeline in seconds since the Unix epoch.<br/><br/>This will be earlier than `process_start_time_seconds` if the pipeline resumed from a checkpoint.  This will be zero if the pipeline resumed from a checkpoint produced by a pipeline too old to record its start time. |

## Input Connectors

These metrics are per-input connector, labeled with `endpoint` set to
the name of the input connector, which is either the name assigned in
the SQL program or automatically generated as `unnamed-<number>`,
where `<number>` counts starting from 1 for the first connector for a
given table.

These metrics accumulate across checkpoint and resume.

For byte counters, for some input connectors, such as columnar
formats, bytes are difficult to attribute accurately to records, so
Feldera approximates.  Feldera also approximately attributes byte
counts to records when it processes only some of the records in a
batch in a DBSP step.  This approximation is corrected when the
remainder of the batch is processed in a subsequent step, so it is
invisible to users unless a pause or checkpoint happens mid-batch.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `input_connector_buffered_records` |gauge | Amount of data currently buffered by an input connector, in records. |
| `input_connector_buffered_records_bytes` |gauge | Amount of data currently buffered by an input connector, in bytes. |
| `input_connector_bytes_total` |counter | Total number of bytes received by an input connector. |
| `input_connector_errors_parse_total` |counter | Total number of errors encountered parsing records received by the input connector. |
| `input_connector_errors_transport_total` |counter | Total number of errors encountered by the input connector at the transport layer. |
| `input_connector_records_total` |counter | Total number of records received by an input connector. |

## Output Connectors

These metrics are per-output connector, labeled with `endpoint` set to
the name of the output connector, which is either the name assigned in
the SQL program or automatically generated as `unnamed-<number>`,
where `<number>` counts starting from 1 for the first connector for a
given view.

These metrics accumulate across checkpoint and resume.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| `output_connector_buffered_records` |gauge | Number of records currently buffered by the output connector. |
| `output_connector_bytes_total` |counter | Total number of bytes of records sent by the output connector. |
| `output_connector_errors_encode_total` |counter | Total number of errors encountered encoding records to send. |
| `output_connector_errors_transport_total` |counter | Total number of errors encountered at the transport layer sending records. |
| `output_connector_records_total` |counter | Total number of records sent by the output connector. |
