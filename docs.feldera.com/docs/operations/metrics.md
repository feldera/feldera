# Pipeline Metrics

<!-- This file is automatically generated.  Do not edit!

To update the documentation, please edit metrics.md.in instead and

This reference lists all of the metrics that Feldera exports through
its `/metrics` endpoint in [Prometheus exposition format].  It is
automatically generated using the documentation embedded in Prometheus
output.

All of the metrics exported by a particular Feldera pipeline are
labeled with the pipeline's UUID as `pipeline`.  Some metrics have
additional labels, as documented below.

See [Monitoring and Profiling] for a guide to setting up Prometheus
and Grafana with Feldera.  The [Feldera template dashboard] is a
sample Grafana dashboard for Feldera.

# Process Metrics

These metrics report statistics for a running Feldera pipeline
process.  When a pipeline process is killed and restarts from a
checkpoint, the new process's metrics are for it alone, not cumulative
with any previous instantiations.

These metrics are intended to match the standard [Prometheus
definitions].

## DBSP metrics

These metrics report statistics for [DBSP], the low-level mechanism on
which Feldera is built.

| <a name='records_processed_total'>`records_processed_total`</a> |counter | Total amount of input processed by the pipeline, in records. |

## Storage Performance

These metrics report the performance of storage, which allows Feldera
to work with data larger than memory.

## Pipeline Status

These metrics report the status of the pipeline.

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :---------- |
| <a name='pipeline_complete'>`pipeline_complete`</a> |counter | Transitions from 0 to 1 when pipeline completes. |
| <a name='pipeline_start_time_seconds'>`pipeline_start_time_seconds`</a> |counter | Start time of the pipeline in seconds since the Unix epoch.<br/><br/>This will be earlier than `process_start_time_seconds` if the pipeline resumed from a checkpoint.  This will be zero if the pipeline resumed from a checkpoint produced by a pipeline too old to record its start time. |

## Input Connectors

These metrics are per-input connector, labeled with `endpoint` set to
the name of the input connector, which is either the name assigned in
the SQL program or automatically generated as `unnamed-<number>`,
where `<number>` counts starting from 1 for the first connector for a
given table.

These metrics accumulate across checkpoint and resume.

For byte counters, for some input connectors, such as columnar
formats, bytes are difficult to attribute accurately to records, so
Feldera approximates.  Feldera also approximately attributes byte
counts to records when it processes only some of the records in a
batch in a DBSP step.  This approximation is corrected when the
remainder of the batch is processed in a subsequent step, so it is
invisible to users unless a pause or checkpoint happens mid-batch.

given view.
