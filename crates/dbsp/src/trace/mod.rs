//! # Traces
//!
//! A "trace" describes how a collection of key-value pairs changes over time.
//! A "batch" is a mostly immutable trace.  This module provides traits and
//! structures for expressing traces in DBSP as collections of `(key, val, time,
//! diff)` tuples.
//!
//! The base trait for a trace is [`BatchReader`], which allows a trace to be
//! read in sorted order by key and value.  `BatchReader` provides [`Cursor`] to
//! step through a batch's tuples without modifying them.
//!
//! The [`Batch`] trait extends [`BatchReader`] with types and methods for
//! creating new traces from ordered tuples ([`Batch::Builder`]) or unordered
//! tuples ([`Batch::Batcher`]), or by merging traces of like types
//! ([`Batch::Merger`]).
//!
//! The [`Trace`] trait, which also extends [`BatchReader`], adds methods to
//! append new batches.  New tuples must not have times earlier than any of the
//! tuples already in the trace.
//!
//! # Time within traces
//!
//! See the [time](crate::time) module documentation for a description of
//! logical times.
//!
//! Traces are sorted by key and value.  They are not sorted with respect to
//! time: reading a trace might obtain out of order and duplicate times among
//! the `(time, diff)` pairs associated with a key and value.
//!
//! Traces keep track of the lower and upper bounds among their tuples' times.
//! If the trace contains incomparable times, then it will have multiple lower
//! and upper bounds, one for each category of incomparable time, in an
//! [`Antichain`].
