//! Traits and datastructures representing a collection trace.
//!
//! A collection trace is a set of updates of the form `(key, val, time, diff)`,
//! which determine the contents of a collection at given times by accumulating
//! updates whose time field is less or equal to the target field.
//!
//! The `Trace` trait describes those types and methods that a data structure
//! must implement to be viewed as a collection trace. This trait allows
//! operator implementations to be generic with respect to the type of trace,
//! and allows various data structures to be interpretable as multiple different
//! types of trace.
