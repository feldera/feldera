//! The `dbsp` crate implements a computational engine for continuous analysis
//! of changing data.  With DBSP, a programmer writes code in terms of
//! computations on a complete data set, but DBSP implements it incrementally,
//! meaning that changes to the data set run in time proportional to the size of
//! the change rather than the size of the data set.  This is a major advantage
//! for applications that work with large data sets that change frequently in
//! small ways.
//!
//! The [`tutorial`] is a good place to start for a guided tour.  After that, if
//! you want to look through the API on your own, the [`circuit`] module is a
//! reasonable starting point.  For complete examples, visit the [`examples`][1]
//! directory in the DBSP repository.

//!
//! # Theory
//!
//! DBSP is underpinned by a formal theory:
//!
//! - [Budiu, Chajed, McSherry, Ryzhyk, Tannen. DBSP: Automatic Incremental View
//!   Maintenance for Rich Query Languages, Conference on Very Large Databases, August
//!   2023, Vancouver, Canada](https://www.feldera.com/vldb23.pdf)
//!
//! - Here is [a presentation about DBSP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT4k5DCnvPU)
//!   at the 2023
//! Apache Calcite Meetup.
//!
//! The model provides two things:
//!
//! 1. **Semantics.** DBSP defines a formal language of streaming operators and
//! queries built out of these operators, and precisely specifies how these
//! queries must transform input streams to output streams.
//!
//! 2. **Algorithm.** DBSP also gives an algorithm that takes an arbitrary query
//! and generates an incremental dataflow program that implements this query
//! correctly (in accordance with its formal semantics) and efficiently.
//! Efficiency here means, in a nutshell, that the cost of processing a set of
//! input events is proportional to the size of the input rather than the entire
//! state of the database.
//!
//! # Crate overview
//!
//! This crate consists of several layers.
//!
//! * [`dynamic`] - Types and traits that support dynamic dispatch.  We heavily rely on
//!   dynamic dispatch to limit the amount of monomorphization performed by the compiler when
//!   building complex dataflow graphs, balancing compilation speed and runtime performance.
//!   This module implements the type machinery necessary to support this architecture.
//!
//! * [`typed_batch`] - Strongly type wrappers around dynamically typed batches and traces.
//!
//! * [`trace`] - This module implements batches and traces, which are core DBSP data structures
//!   that represent tables, indexes and changes to tables and indexes.  We provide both in-memory
//!   and persistent batch and trace implementations.
//!
//! * [`operator::dynamic`] - Dynamically typed operator API. Operators transform data streams
//!   (usually carrying data in the form of batches and traces).  DBSP provides many relational
//!   operators, such as map, filter, aggregate, join, etc.  The operator API in this module is
//!   dynamically typed and unsafe.
//!
//! * [`operator`] - Statically typed wrappers around the dynamic API in [`operator::dynamic`].
