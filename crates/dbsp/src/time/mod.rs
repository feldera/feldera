//! # Logical time
//!
//! Every value produced by a DBSP operator is logically labelled by the time
//! when it was produced.  A logical time can be represented as an array of
//! integers whose length is equal to the nesting depth of the circuit and whose
//! `i`th element is the local time of the circuit at the `i`th nesting level.
//! A root circuit has a 1-dimensional logical clock, which starts at 0 and
//! increments by 1 at each clock tick, a nested circuit has a 2-dimensional
//! logical clock, and so on.
//!
//! The [`Timestamp`] trait captures common functionality of logical time
//! representation.
//!
//! # Lossy times
//!
//! In practice, if a logical time needs to be stored explicitly (which is not
//! always necessary), we use a more compact "lossy" representation of logical
//! time that stores just enough timing information for operators that compute
//! on the data.
//!
//! ## Example: Untimed data
//!
//! We use unit type `()` for untimed data, where we only track values and not
//! the time when each value was generated.
//!
//! The [`integrate_trace`](`crate::circuit::Stream::integrate_trace`) operator
//! computes the union of all Z-sets in its input stream generated during the
//! current clock epoch, i.e., since the last
//! [`clock_start`](`crate::circuit::operator_traits::Operator::clock_start`)
//! invocation.  Its consumers only need to know the current value of the
//! sum and not when each update was produced.  It therefore stores its output
//! in an untimed [`Trace`]([`crate::trace::Trace`]), i.e., a trace whose
//! timestamp type is `()`.
//!
//! ## Example: [`NestedTimestamp32`]
//!
//! [`NestedTimestamp32`] represents nested timestamp `(c1, c2)`, but only uses
//! 1 bit for `c1`, which is enough to distinguish data generated in the latest
//! clock epoch from all earlier epochs.  This distinction by itself is
//! sufficient for all existing DBSP operators.
//!
//! [`join`](`crate::circuit::Stream::join`) and
//! [`distinct`](`crate::circuit::Stream::distinct`) methods compute incremental
//! versions of `join` and `distinct` operators within nested scopes.  They need
//! to know the exact local time in the child circuit when each key-value tuple
//! was generated; however they do not require the exact parent clock value as
//! long as they can distinguish between values generated during the current
//! epoch (i.e., the current parent clock cycle) from older values.  They
//! therefore take advantage of the lossy timestamp representation implemented
//! by [`NestedTimestamp32`].
//!
//! # Comparing times
//!
//! Timestamps partially order logical time.  Multidimensional timestamps, in
//! particular, are not totally ordered: `(x1,x2) <= (y1,y2)` if and only if `x1
//! <= y1 && x2 <= y2`, so that, e.g. `(1,2)` and `(2,1)` are not comparable.
//! The [`PartialOrder`] trait that bounds `Timestamp` allows this logical time
//! ordering to be separate from the ordinary [`PartialOrd`] used for, e.g.,
//! sorting.
