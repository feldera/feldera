/// A trait for aggregator objects.  An aggregator summarizes the contents
/// of a Z-set into a single value.
///
/// This trait supports two aggregation methods that can be combined in
/// various ways to compute the aggregate efficiently.  First, the
/// [`aggregate`](`Self::aggregate`) method takes a cursor pointing to
/// the first key of a Z-set and scans the cursor to compute the aggregate
/// over all values in the cursor.  Second, the
/// [`Semigroup`](`Self::Semigroup`) associated type allows aggregating
/// partitioned Z-sets by combining aggregates computed over individual
/// partitions (e.g., computed by different worker threads).
///
/// This design requires aggregate values to form a semigroup with a `+`
/// operation such that `Agg(x + y) = Agg(x) + Agg(y)`, i.e., aggregating
/// a union of two Z-sets must produce the same result as the sum of
/// individual aggregates.  Not all aggregates have this property.  E.g.,
/// the average value of a Z-set cannot be computed by combining the
/// averages of its subsets.  We can get around this problem by representing
/// average as `(sum, count)` tuple with point-wise `+` operator
/// `(sum1, count1) + (sum2, count2) = (sum1+sum2, count1+count2)`.
/// The final result is converted to an actual average value by dividing
/// the first element of the tuple by the second.  This is a general technique
/// that works for all aggregators (although it may not always be optimal).
///
/// To support such aggregates, this trait distinguishes between the
/// `Accumulator` type returned by [`aggregate`](`Self::aggregate`),
/// which must implement
/// [`trait Semigroup`](`crate::algebra::Semigroup`), and the final
/// [`Output`](`Self::Output`) of the aggregator.  The latter is
/// computed by applying the [`finalize`](`Self::finalize`) method
/// to the final value of the accumulator.
///
/// This is a low-level trait that is mostly used to build libraries of
/// aggregators.  Users will typically work with ready-made implementations
/// like [`Min`](`crate::operator::Min`) and [`Fold`](`crate::operator::Fold`).

    /// meaning that computing the aggregate piecewise and combining
    /// the results using `Self::Semigroup` should yield the same value as
    /// aggregating the entire input using `Self::aggregate`.
    // TODO: We currently only use this with `radix_tree`, which only
    // requires the semigroup structure (i.e., associativity).  In the future
    // we will also use this in computing regular aggregates by combining
    // per-worker aggregates computes over arbitrary subsets of values,
    // which additionally requires commutativity.  Do we want to introduce
