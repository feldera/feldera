# DBSP

Database Stream Processor (DBSP) is a computational engine for
continuous analysis of changing data.  With DBSP, a programmer writes
code in terms of computations on a complete data set, but DBSP
implements it incrementally, meaning that changes to the data set run
in time proportional to the size of the change rather than the size of
the data set.  This is a major advantage for applications that work
with large data sets that change frequently in small ways.

The DBSP computational engine is a component of the [Feldera
Continuous Analytics Platform](https://www.feldera.com).

# Example

```
use dbsp::{operator::FilterMap, IndexedZSet, OrdIndexedZSet, OutputHandle, Runtime};

type Node = usize;
type Weight = isize;

// Creates a series of graph edges, then counts the number of times each source
// node appears, then counts the number of times each count appears.
fn main() {
    let edges = 100; // Number of initial edges in the graph.
    let sources = 13; // Number of source nodes in the graph.
    let extra = 5; // Number of extra edges added later to the graph.
    let threads = 2; // Number of threads.

    let (mut dbsp, (hedges, degrees, distribution)) = Runtime::init_circuit(threads, |circuit| {
        let (edges, hedges) = circuit.add_input_zset::<(Node, Node), Weight>();

        // Count the number of edges with each node as its source (each node's
        // out-degree).
        let degrees = edges.map(|(src, _dst)| *src).weighted_count();

        // Count the number of nodes with each out-degree.
        let distribution = degrees.map(|(_src, count)| *count).weighted_count();

        Ok((hedges, degrees.output(), distribution.output()))
    })
    .unwrap();

    // Add some initial edges and print the results.
    for i in 0..edges {
        hedges.push((i % sources, i % 7), 1);
    }
    dbsp.step().unwrap();
    println!("Initialization:");
    print_changes(&degrees, &distribution);

    // Add a few more nodes and print the changes.
    for i in 0..extra {
        hedges.push((i % sources, i % 9), 1);
    }
    dbsp.step().unwrap();
    println!("Changes:");
    print_changes(&degrees, &distribution);

    dbsp.kill().unwrap();
}

fn print_changes(
    degrees: &OutputHandle<OrdIndexedZSet<Node, isize, Weight>>,
    distribution: &OutputHandle<OrdIndexedZSet<isize, isize, Weight>>,
) {
    for (src, outdegree, weight) in degrees.consolidate().iter() {
        println!("    {weight:+}: Node {src} has out-degree {outdegree}");
    }
    for (outdegree, count, weight) in distribution.consolidate().iter() {
        println!("    {weight:+}: {count} nodes have out-degree {outdegree}");
    }
}
