//! Data transports.
//!
//! Data transport adapters implement support for a specific streaming
//! technology like Kafka.  A transport adapter carries data without
//! interpreting it (data interpretation is the job of **data format** adapters
//! found in [dbsp_adapters::format](crate::format)).
//!
//! Both input and output data transport adapters exist.  Some transports
//! have both input and output variants, and others only have one.
//!
//! Data transports are created and configured through Yaml, with a string name
//! that designates a transport and a transport-specific Yaml object to
//! configure it.  Transport configuration is encapsulated in
//! [`dbsp_adapters::TransportConfig`](crate::TransportConfig).
//!
//! To obtain a transport, create an endpoint with it, and then start reading it
//! from the beginning:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let endpoint = input_transport_config_to_endpoint(config.clone());
//! let reader = endpoint.open(consumer, 0);
//! ```
