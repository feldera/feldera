//! Runtime support for `samply`.
//!
//! The [samply] profiler allows the process that it is profiling to indicate
//! important runtime spans so that they show up in the profile for the thread
//! or the process.  The way that the profiled process does this is somewhat
//! arcane, so this module provides support for this on supported systems.
//!
//! Use [SamplySpan] to emit a span.
//!
//! # Viewing in the Firefox Profiler
//!
//! Spans logged by this module show up in the Marker Chart and Marker Table
//! tabs for a given thread. They are linked to particular threads and the
//! profiler will only show them when those threads are selected.  Those threads
//! *should* be the ones that emit them, but when `samply` attaches to a process
//! that is already running, it cannot tell which thread emitted them, so it
//! links all of them to the main thread (the one with the process name at the
//! top of the profiler window).  For Feldera pipelines, this usually means that
//! all of the spans will be linked to the main thread.
//!
//! See [example] output, which should show spans for `input`, `step`, and
//! `update` in the track for `program_0198a9c5-3b...`.
//!
//! [example]: https://profiler.firefox.com/public/5r65r8dg7estdv9sgd154qf2ta7japgp0hm7r50/marker-chart/?globalTrackOrder=0&hiddenLocalTracksByPid=1305600-0whjowx3x7xawzhznwAb&range=14344m640~14344m184&symbolServer=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A3001%2F3d9s4vp2mr2q30dw5rr3n09f7xgpds0mh8cr5nw&thread=0zjwzn&v=11
//!
//! # Enabling
//!
//! Logging must be configured to enable emitting spans at runtime:
//!
//! - Debug-level logging must be enabled for this module.
//!
//! - Logging must also be enabled for the particular spans of interest.  These
//!   are probably also at debug level.
//!
//! For Feldera pipelines, the easiest way to enable logging these spans is
//! probably to enable debug-level logging globally by setting `"logging":
//! "debug"` for the pipeline.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! There is some performance cost for emitting a span:
//!
//! - Each thread that emits a span writes a temporary file and retains a file
//!   descriptor for it.
//!
//! - Emitting a span takes one system call to write a line to the temporary
//!   file.  (In theory, this can be avoided using `mmap` to write the file, but
//!   writing text files with `mmap` is a nasty business and so far we avoid
//!   it.)
//!
//! # Cleanup
//!
//! The process can't delete its temporary files when it exits, because `samply`
//! needs to read them afterward.  Pass `--unlink-aux-files` to samply to have
//! it delete them after reading.
//!
//! This implementation writes the temporary files in a temporary directory.
//! Nothing deletes the temporary directory.
//!
