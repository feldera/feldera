///   period expires.
///
/// * State transitions labeled with API endpoint names (`/start`, `/pause`,
///   `/stop`) are triggered by invoking corresponding endpoint,
///   e.g., `POST /v0/pipelines/{name}/start`. Note that these only express
///   desired state, and are applied asynchronously by the automata.

/// ### Desired and actual status
///
/// We use the desired state model to manage the lifecycle of a pipeline.
/// In this model, the pipeline has two status attributes associated with
/// it at runtime: the **desired** status, which represents what the user
/// would like the pipeline to do, and the **current** status, which
/// represents the actual state of the pipeline.  The pipeline runner
/// service continuously monitors both fields and steers the pipeline
/// towards the desired state specified by the user.
///
/// Only four of the states in the pipeline automaton above can be
/// used as desired statuses: `Paused`, `Running`, `Suspended` and
/// `Stopped`. These statuses are selected by invoking REST endpoints
/// shown in the diagram (respectively, `/pause`, `/start`, and `/stop`).
///
/// The user can monitor the current state of the pipeline via the
/// `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}` endpoint. In a typical scenario,
/// the user first sets the desired state, e.g., by invoking the
/// `/start` endpoint, and then polls the `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}`
/// endpoint to monitor the actual status of the pipeline until its
/// `deployment_status` attribute changes to `Running` indicating
/// that the pipeline has been successfully initialized and is
/// processing data, or `Stopped` with `deployment_error` being set.
