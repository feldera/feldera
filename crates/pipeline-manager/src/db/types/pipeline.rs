///
/// The following automaton captures the lifecycle of the pipeline.
/// Individual states and transitions of the automaton are described below.
///
/// * States labeled with the hourglass symbol (⌛) are **timed** states. The
///   automaton stays in timed state until the corresponding operation completes
///   or until it transitions to become failed after the pre-defined timeout
///   period expires.
///
/// * State transitions labeled with API endpoint names (`/start`, `/pause`,
///   `/shutdown`) are triggered by invoking corresponding endpoint,
///   e.g., `POST /v0/pipelines/{name}/start`. Note that these only express
///   desired state, and are applied asynchronously by the automata.

/// ### Desired and actual status
///
/// We use the desired state model to manage the lifecycle of a pipeline.
/// In this model, the pipeline has two status attributes associated with
/// it at runtime: the **desired** status, which represents what the user
/// would like the pipeline to do, and the **current** status, which
/// represents the actual state of the pipeline.  The pipeline runner
/// service continuously monitors both fields and steers the pipeline
/// towards the desired state specified by the user.
// Using rustdoc references in the following paragraph upsets `docusaurus`.
/// Only three of the states in the pipeline automaton above can be
/// used as desired statuses: `Paused`, `Running`, and `Shutdown`.
/// These statuses are selected by invoking REST endpoints shown
/// in the diagram.
///
/// The user can monitor the current state of the pipeline via the
/// `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}` endpoint, which returns an object of type
/// `ExtendedPipelineDescr`. In a typical scenario, the user first sets
/// the desired state, e.g., by invoking the `/start` endpoint, and
/// then polls the `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}` endpoint to monitor the
/// actual status of the pipeline until its `deployment_status` attribute
/// changes to "running" indicating that the pipeline has been successfully
/// initialized and is processing data, or "failed", indicating an error.
