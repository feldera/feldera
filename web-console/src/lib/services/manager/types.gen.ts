     * # Requirements
     *
     * * The timestamp column must be of a supported type: integer, `DATE`, or `TIMESTAMP`.
     * * The timestamp column must be declared with non-zero `LATENESS`.

 *
 * ### `InsertDelete`
 *
 * Each element in the input stream consists of an "insert" or "delete"

 *
 * ```json
 * {"insert": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

 * which indicates how many times the row appears.
 *
 * ```json
 * {"weight": 2, "data": {"column1": "hello, world!", "column2": 100}}

 * ### `Debezium`
 *
 * Debezium CDC format.  Refer to [Debezium input connector documentation](https://docs.feldera.com/connectors/sources/debezium) for details.
 *
 * ### `Snowflake`
 *
 * Uses flat structure so that fields can get parsed directly into SQL
 * columns.  Defines three metadata fields:
 *
 * * `__action` - "insert" or "delete"
 * * `__stream_id` - unique 64-bit ID of the output stream (records within
 * a stream are totally ordered)
 * * `__seq_number` - monotonically increasing sequence number relative to

 * ```
 *
 * ### `Raw`
 *
 * This format is suitable for insert-only streams (no deletions).
 * Each element in the input stream contains a record without any
 * additional envelope that gets inserted in the input table.

/**
 * Pipeline status.
 *
 * This type represents the state of the pipeline tracked by the pipeline
 * runner and observed by the API client via the `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}` endpoint.
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a pipeline
 *
 * The following automaton captures the lifecycle of the pipeline.
 * Individual states and transitions of the automaton are described below.
 *
 * * States labeled with the hourglass symbol (⌛) are **timed** states. The
 * automaton stays in timed state until the corresponding operation completes
 * or until it transitions to become failed after the pre-defined timeout
 * period expires.
 *
 * * State transitions labeled with API endpoint names (`/start`, `/pause`,
 * `/shutdown`) are triggered by invoking corresponding endpoint,
 * e.g., `POST /v0/pipelines/{name}/start`. Note that these only express
 * desired state, and are applied asynchronously by the automata.

 *
 * ### Desired and actual status
 *
 * We use the desired state model to manage the lifecycle of a pipeline.
 * In this model, the pipeline has two status attributes associated with
 * it at runtime: the **desired** status, which represents what the user
 * would like the pipeline to do, and the **current** status, which
 * represents the actual state of the pipeline.  The pipeline runner
 * service continuously monitors both fields and steers the pipeline
 * towards the desired state specified by the user.
 * Only three of the states in the pipeline automaton above can be
 * used as desired statuses: `Paused`, `Running`, and `Shutdown`.
 * These statuses are selected by invoking REST endpoints shown
 * in the diagram.
 *
 * The user can monitor the current state of the pipeline via the
 * `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}` endpoint. In a typical scenario,
 * the user first sets the desired state, e.g., by invoking the
 * `/start` endpoint, and then polls the `GET /v0/pipelines/{name}`
 * endpoint to monitor the actual status of the pipeline until its
 * `deployment_status` attribute changes to `Running` indicating
 * that the pipeline has been successfully initialized and is
 * processing data, or `Failed`, indicating an error.
