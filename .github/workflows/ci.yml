        # By default a merge commit is checked out. If you look at the SHA that
        # is checked out, it doesn't match your local commit SHA. Rather it's
        # the SHA of a merge commit (your branch + base branch). So for
        # pull_request actions it won't match the commit ID on the branch. This
        # is confusing for storing benchmark results because the commit ID we
        # find during `git rev-parse` exists nowhere in the history. Since we
        # don't do merge commits anyways, we make sure we check out the head
        # commit (which will exist in the history).
