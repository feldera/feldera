# This would be easier if we could just build all platforms in one job, but
# building the ARM version on x86 is very slow due to the pre-compile step we do
# in the Dockerfile.
#
# See also https://github.com/docker/build-push-action/issues/671 and especially the linked solution
# https://docs.docker.com/build/ci/github-actions/multi-platform/#distribute-build-across-multiple-runners
# for more details on how this produces a single image with multiple architectures from different runners.
