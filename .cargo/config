# We are using UUID v7 which is in final comment period (ends June 9):

#
# Why do we use v7:
#
# The summary seems to be that uuids as primary keys were a bad idea in the past because of the
# format, so some people advocated for using TSIDs. It seems that UUIDv7 fixes most of
# those shortcomings (by being similar to TSIDs) so the general consus
# is to use UUIDv7 for databases now.
