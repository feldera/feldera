# SQL to DBSP compiler

This directory holds the source code for a compiler translating SQL
view definitions into DBSP circuits.  The SQL compiler is based on the
Apache Calcite compiler infrastructure <https://calcite.apache.org/>

## Dependencies

The code has been tested on Windows 10/11 and Linux.

You need Java 8 or later to build the compiler, and the maven (mvn)
Java build program.  Maven will take care of installing all required
Java dependencies.

The code generated by the compiler is Rust.  To run it you need a
working installation of Rust (we recommend using rustup to install:
<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>).  The compiler uses the
current version of the DBSP library sources from github
(<https://github.com/feldera/feldera>).

If you want to generate images of the query plans you need
to also install graphviz as described here <https://graphviz.org/download/>.

## Building

To build the compiler run:
```
mvn -DskipTests package
```

## Rust compilation errors

If you get Rust compilation errors you should try to make sure you
have the latest version of the Rust libraries and toolchain:

```
$ rustup update
$ cd temp
$ cargo update
```

(`temp` is the directory where the tests write the generated Rust code.)

## Incremental view maintenance

The DBSP runtime is optimized for performing incremental view
maintenance.  In consequence, DBSP programs in SQL are expressed as
VIEWS, or *standing queries*.  A view is essentially a computation
that describes a relation that is computed from other tables or views.

For example, the following query defines a view:

```sql
CREATE VIEW V AS SELECT T.COL1 FROM T WHERE T.age > 18
```

In order to interpret this query the compiler needs to have been given
a definition of table (or view) T.  The table T should be defined
using a SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statement, e.g.:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE T
(
    name    VARCHAR,
    age     INT,
    present BOOLEAN
)
```

The compiler must be given the table definition first, and then the
view definition.  The compiler generates a Rust library which
implements the query as a function: given the input data, it produces
the output data.

The compiler can (optionally) generate a library which will
incrementally maintain the view `V` when presented with changes to
table `T`:

```
                                           table changes
                                                V
tables -----> SQL-to-DBSP compiler ------> DBSP circuit
views                                           V
                                           view changes
```

## Compiler architecture

[A presentation](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AlywK8G1COQ_lel0fMSX1CvrRS7HYw?e=I9JPBT)
about the internals of the compiler implementation.

Compilation proceeds in several stages:

- SQL statements are parsed using the calcite SQL parser
  generating an IR representation using the Calcite `SqlNode` data types
- the SQL IR tree is validated, optimized, and converted to the Calcite `RelNode` representation
- The result of this stage is a `CalciteProgram` data structure, which packages together all the
  views that are being compiled (multiple views can be maintained simultaneously)
- `CalciteToDBSPCompiler` converts a `CalciteProgram` data structure into a `DBSPCircuit`
  data structure.
- The `CircuitOptimizer` class can optimize the generated circuit, optionally converting
  it into an incremental circuit, which is expected to compute only on changes.
- The `circuit` can be serialized as Rust using the `ToRustString` visitor.

## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit tests are written using JUnit and test pointwise parts of the
compiler.  They can be executed using `mvn test`.  They also run as a
side effect of `mvn package` (omitting `-DskipTests`).

The unit tests are implemented as individual Java files under
`sql-to-dbsp-compiler/SQL-compiler/src/test/java/org/dbsp/sqlCompiler/compiler/`.
Each unit test uses the SQL to DBSP compiler to generate Rust code under
`sql-to-dbsp-compiler/temp` and compiles and runs that code.

If one of the unit tests fails, you may re-populate the Rust code for
it into `temp` by telling `mvn` to run only that particular test.  If
an error message indicates that
`org.dbsp.sqlCompiler.compiler.postgres.PostgresTimestampTests`
failed, for example, you may rerun just that test, first with `mvn
test` and then again with `cargo test`, via:

```
$ mvn test -Dtest=PostgresTimestampTests
$ cd ../temp
$ cargo test
```

### SQL logic tests

One of the means of testing the compiler is using sqllogictests:
<https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki>.

The sqllogictests includes more than 5 million tests.  It takes weeks
to run all of them.  Most of the time is spent compiling Rust.
We hope to speed that up at some point.

To start running these tests:

```
$ ./run-tests.sh
```

We have implemented a [general-purpose testing
framework](https://github.com/hydromatic/sql-logic-test) in Java for
running SqlLogicTest programs.  The framework parses SqlLogicTest
files and creates an internal representation of these files.  The
files are executed by "test executors".

The tests are run by a standalone executable (the executable is
invoked by the `run-tests.sh` script).  The executable supports the
following command-line arguments:

```
slt [options] files_or_directories_with_tests
Executes the SQL Logic Tests using a SQL execution engine
See https://www.sqlite.org/sqllogictest/doc/trunk/about.wiki
Options:
-h            Show this help message and exit
-x            Stop at the first encountered query error
-n            Do not execute, just parse the test files
-e executor   Executor to use
-b filename   Load a list of buggy commands to skip from this file
-v            Increase verbosity (can be repeated)
-inc          Incremental validation
-u username   Postgres user name
-p password   Postgres password
Registered executors:
        hybrid
        dbsp
        hsql
        psql
        none
```

We have multiple executors.  Some executors are inherited
from the hydromatic project.

#### The `NoExecutor` test executor

This executor is part of the base hydromatic package; it does not
really run any tests.  But it can still be used by the test loading
mechanism to check that we correctly parse all SQL logic test files.

#### The `DBSPExecutor`

The model of SQLLogicTest has to be adapted for testing using DBSP.
Since DBSP is not a database, but a streaming system, some SQL
statements are ignored (e.g., `CREATE INDEX`) and some other
cannot be supported (e.g., `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX`).

* The DDL statements to create tables are compiled into definitions of
  circuit inputs.
* The DML INSERT statements are converted into input-generating functions.
  In the absence of a database we cannot really execute statements that
  are supposed to fail, so we ignore such statements.
* Some DML statements like DELETE based on a WHERE clause cannot be compiled at all
* The queries are converted into DDL VIEW create statements, which are
  compiled into circuits.
* The validation rules in SQLLogicTest are compiled into Rust functions that compare
  the outputs of queries.

So a SqlLogicTest script is turned into multiple DBSP tests, each of
which creates a circuit, feeds it one input, reads the output, and
validates it, executing exactly one transaction.  When testing
incremental circuits the test code feeds multiple inputs and
only checks the final output.

#### The `hybrid` executor

This executor is a combination of the DBSP executor and the JDBC
executor, using a real database to store data in tables, but using
DBSP as a query engine.  It should be able to execute all SqlLogicTest
queries that are supported by the underlying database.

#### SqlLogicTest Test results

The 'inc' column shows tests for incremental circuits, the other
columns show tests for non-incremental (standard) implementations.

The matrix represents the current test results; the numbers indicate
the passing/failing tests in each category.  The failing test cases
are detailed below.

| evidence             |         N/A |    153/25 |               |

The "index" tests cannot be executed with the `DBSPExecutor` since it
does not support the "unique index" SQL statement.

### Postgres tests

We are manually converting Postgres tests
<https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/test/regress/expected>
to run on DBSP, since the Postgres SQL syntax is too different from
the Calcite syntax (especially in the functions supported).  In some
cases the semantics of Postgres SQL is different from Calcite; for
example, in Postgres the days of the week are numbered from 0, where 0
is Sunday, but in Calcite the days of the week are numbered from 1,
where 1 is Sunday.  In such cases we have to change the tests.
