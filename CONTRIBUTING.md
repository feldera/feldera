# Contributing to Feldera

The Feldera team welcomes contributions from the community. Before you start working with Feldera, please
read our [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).
To acknowledge the DCO, sign your commits by adding `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>` to the last
line of each Git commit message.  Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch.  The e-mail address used to sign must match the e-mail address of the Git
author. If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git config values, you can sign your commit automatically
with `git commit -s`.

## Dependencies

Our team develops and tests using Linux and MacOS. Windows Subsystem for Linux works fine too.

The Feldera container images and CI workflows use Linux. You can see our setup in
our [Dockerfile](deploy/Dockerfile) and [Earthfile](Earthfile).

Our known dependencies are:
- Runtime
  - a Rust tool chain (install rustup and the default toolchain)
    - this will need a C and C++ compiler installed (e.g., gcc, gcc++)
    - cmake
    - libdev-ssl
- SQL Compiler
  - a Java Virtual Machine (at least Java 19)
    - maven
  - graphviz
- Cloud and UI
  - Python 3
  - typescript
  - Redpanda or Kafka
  - Earthly (https://earthly.dev/get-earthly)

Additional dependencies are automatically installed by the Rust,
maven, Python, and typescript build tools.

## Contribution Flow

### Forking

We recommend forking the Feldera repository and contributing from a fork.
This [page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)
has instructions on how to fork a repository.  After forking do not
forget to add Feldera as a remote repository:

```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/feldera/feldera.git
```

### Workflow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work
- Make commits of logical units
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below)
- Push your changes to a topic branch in the repository (push to your fork if
  you don't have commit access to the Feldera repository --- pushing directly
  to the repo is preferred because then CI will be able to add benchmark
  results to the PR in the comments).
- Submit a pull request

Example:

``` shell
git checkout -b my-new-feature main
git commit -a
git push origin my-new-feature
```

### Staying In Sync With Upstream

When your branch gets out of sync with the feldera/main branch, use the following to update:

``` shell
git checkout my-new-feature
git fetch -a
git pull --rebase upstream main
git push --force-with-lease upstream my-new-feature
```

If you don't have permissions replace the last command with

```
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

### Updating pull requests

If your PR fails to pass CI or needs changes based on code review, you'll most likely want to squash these changes into
existing commits.

If your pull request contains a single commit or your changes are related to the most recent commit, you can simply
amend the commit.

``` shell
git add <files to add>
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

If you need to squash changes into an earlier commit, you can use:

``` shell
git add <files to add>
git commit --fixup <commit>
git rebase -i --autosquash main
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

Be sure to add a comment to the PR indicating your new changes are ready to review, as GitHub does not generate a
notification when you git push.

### Merging a pull request

Since we run benchmarks as part of the CI, it's a good practice to preserve the commit IDs of the feature branch
we've worked on (and benchmarked). Unfortunately, [the github UI does not have support for this](https://github.com/community/community/discussions/4618)
(it only allows rebase, squash and merge commits to close PRs).
Therefore, it's recommended to merge PRs using the following git CLI invocation:

```shell
git checkout main
git merge --ff-only feature-branch-name
git push upstream main
```


### Code Style

Execute the following command to make `git push` check the code for formatting issues.

```shell
GITDIR=$(git rev-parse --git-dir)
ln -sf $(pwd)/scripts/pre-push ${GITDIR}/hooks/pre-push
```
### Formatting Commit Messages

We follow the conventions on [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

Be sure to include any related GitHub issue references in the commit message.  See
[GFM syntax](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) for referencing issues
and commits.

## Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

When opening a new issue, try to roughly follow the commit message format conventions above.


# For developers

## Building Feldera from sources

Feldera is implemented in Rust and uses Rust's `cargo` build system. The SQL
to DBSP compiler is implemented in Java and uses `maven` as its build system.

You can build the rust sources by runnning the following at the top level of this tree.

```
cargo build
```

To build the SQL to DBSP compiler, run the following from `sql-to-dbsp-compiler/SQL-compiler`:

```
mvn package
```

If you want to develop Feldera without installing the required toolchains
locally, you can use Github Codespaces; from
https://github.com/feldera/feldera, click on the green `<> Code` button,
then select Codespaces and click on "Create codespace on main".

## Learning the DBSP Rust code

DBSP is a key crate that powers Feldera's pipelines.
To learn how the DBSP core works, we recommend starting with the tutorial.

From the project root:

```
cargo doc --open
```

Then search for `dbsp::tutorial`.

Another good place to start is the `circuit::circuit_builder` module documentation,
or the examples folder.  For more sophisticated examples, try looking
at the `nexmark` benchmark in the `benches` directory.

## Running Benchmarks against DBSP

The repository has a number of benchmarks available in the `benches` directory that provide a comparison of DBSP's performance against a known set of tests.

Each benchmark has its own options and behavior, as outlined below.

### Nexmark Benchmark

You can run the complete set of Nexmark queries, with the default settings, with:

```shell
cargo bench --bench nexmark
```

By default this will run each query with a total of 100 million events emitted at 10M per second (by two event generator threads), using 2 CPU cores for processing the data.

To run just the one query, q3, with only 10 million events, but using 8 CPU cores to process the data and 6 event generator threads, you can run:

```shell
cargo bench --bench nexmark -- --query q3 --max-events 10000000 --cpu-cores 8 --num-event-generators 6
```

For further options that you can use with the Nexmark benchmark,

```shell
cargo bench --bench nexmark -- --help
```

## Updating the pipeline manager database schema

The pipeline manager serves as the API server for Feldera. It persists API state in a Postgres DB instance.
Here are some guidelines when contributing code that affects this database's schema.

* We use SQL migrations to apply the schema to a live database to facilitate upgrades. We use [refinery](https://github.com/rust-db/refinery) to manage migrations.
* The migration files can be found in `crates/pipeline_manager/migrations`
* Do not modify an existing migration file. If you want to evolve the schema, add a new SQL or rust file to the migrations folder following [refinery's versioning and naming scheme](https://docs.rs/refinery/latest/refinery/#usage). The migration script should update an existing schema as opposed to assuming a clean slate. For example, use `ALTER TABLE` to add a new column to an existing table and fill that column for existing rows with the appropriate defaults.
* If you add a new migration script `V{i}`, add tests for migrations from `V{i-1}` to `V{i}`. For example, add tests that invoke the pipeline manager APIs before and after the migration.


## Release process

There are a few steps to put out a new Feldera release. At a high-level, there
are two phases. First, we put out a release commit which involves updating the
CHANGELOG and bumping package versions, which we then put out a Github release
with. Second, if the previous phase is successful and we are happy with the
released container images, we then put out a post-release commit that updates
existing docker-compose manifests to make use of the newly released container
images.

### Phase 1: release commit

First, make sure sure
you have pulled the latest changes into your local main branch.

```
git pull origin main
```

Next, run the following script from the `scripts` folder:

```
cd scripts
./bump-versions.sh <major / minor / patch>
```

If the `Unreleased` section of the CHANGELOG has new features (i.e., an `Added`
section), we perform a minor release. If we only have bug fixes, we perform a
patch release. We currently do not do `major` releases as we are not ready for
1.0 yet.

Running the above command should switch to a new branch called `release-vX.Y.Z`
where `X.Y.Z` is the new release version. It should have created a commit that
bumped the version and updated the CHANGELOG. You can check the changes by
running:

```
git show
```

There will also be uncommitted changes you can view with `git diff`. We will
merge these changes only after the commited changes are released in phase 2.

Push the committed changes to Github and create a PR. Once the CI passes, merge
it into main, and create a new release from Github. Create a new tag from
within the `release` page on Github. Follow the versioning format of `vX.Y.Z`
when creating the new tag. Add the CHANGELOG entry to the release description.

### Phase 2: post-release commit

Once the release is out, keep an eye on the CI on the main branch. It should
eventually put out containers for the new release (an action called
`containers.yml`). Test the containers locally once that action succeeds.

Once the released containers look fine, it's time to switch the docker-compose
files in the repository to point to the newly released containers. To do so,
let's go back to the uncommitted changes in your local `release-vX.Y.Z` branch.
Create a new branch, commit these changes and get a pull request merged for
this new commit:

```
git checkout -b post-release-vX.Y.Z
git commit -am "docker: point compose file to Feldera version X.Y.Z" -s
git push origin post-release-vX.Y.Z
```
